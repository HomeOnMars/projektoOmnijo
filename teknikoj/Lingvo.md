Fonrakonto de la Epopo
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Background story of Epopo
> <br>
> [Back to OmniCentro Content](../OmniCentro.md#detalaj-informoj)

The official language in [RdO](Bulteno.md#fonrakonta-bulteno) is
***Esperanto++*** (often written as `E++` or `Epopo`),
a fictional variant of L. L. Zamenhof's artificial language
[*Esperanto*](https://lernu.net/esperanto) (1887),
with multiple changes specified by
<span style="color:Beige">Reĝinʌ Serena</span> herself,
aiming to offer even more regularity and inclusivity,
while conforming to the existing world as much as possible[^Lingvo-Historio-1].
It was declared the new official language of RdO by
<span style="color:Beige">Queen Serena</span> about three months in her reign,
set to gradually replace English in the next *hekjaro* (hexcade, i.e. 16 years)
in all RdO official documentations and communications.

[^Lingvo-Historio-1]: Contrary to what one might expect,
  many Esperantists are not exactly big fans of the Queen breaking the
  traditions of their language unilaterally with the many changes she made…
  which is why <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> decided
  to give her langauge a new name.

While the <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span>'s motivation seems arbitrary,
it is the case that the island has an aboriginal islander language,
as the first people there developed their own distinct culture.
It was suppressed during the British Colonial Period of the island, however;
during which the official language was forced into English,
despite the co-existence of a smaller but sizable colonist population
from mostly Spain and France (and later, China and India)
who came along with the Brits.
Even after the island gained independence with the clever political maneuvers
from the old king (and the old general) decades ago with the locals' support,
English remained as the official languages on the island for everyone—
from the dwindling British populations, to the aboriginals,
to the local Spanish / French / Chinese / Indian communities.
While the people were too caught up in the corruption, poverty,
and political infighting to propose anything else,
<span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s rise brought enough stablities
such that different groups now have the political will
to ask for something more—
a new official language that will cast the island's colonial past away.  
And lo and behold, everyone proposed their own language to be the one.  
The <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span>, being a Gen-Z growing up in a
mostly English-speaking environment with many multilingual neighbours (claimed),
seems to have given up the constant negotiations with all the different sides,
ditching them all in favor of a new common langauge for everyone instead—
"A modern, sensible language befitting the future!"
as <span style="color:Beige">she</span> declares.

The result is Esperanto++, or *Epopo*.

As <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> pokes around Esperanto
and adjusts her version of it to her liking,
it's hard to say if she is doing this to "modernize" the language
or simply because she is having fun making up rules.
Nevertheless, one would think that such random policy
is surely going to cause massive civil unrest;
however, by that time people already got used to
<span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s ridiculous style,
and they also have the chaotic implementation of
her new UBI (universal basic income) policy to worry about.

Epopo
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Epopo

Changes of Esperanto++ (*Epopo*) from Esperanto include:

### Alfabeto

> Alphabet

#### Elementoj

- Officially eliminated `Ĥ` from the *Epopo* alphabet
  (mostly replaced with `K`);
- Added `Q` (Qi-), `X` (Xi-), `Ʌ` (-ü) for more diverse sounds,
  inspired by [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin).  
  No words from *Epopo* are using `Q, X` yet;
  for now they are only used in naming.
  See [-ʌ suffix](#-ʌ-sufikso) section for `Ʌ` main usage.
- `oŭ` is allowed and used in Epopo.
- Note that 'Ʌ', 'JɅ', and 'ĴɅ' could sound similar.
  Generally speaking, try not to add 'J' or 'Ĵ' in front of 'Ʌ'
  when making up words.
- 'ĈɅ' and 'QɅ' could also sound similar.
  In this case, avoid using 'ĈɅ' and replace them with 'QɅ'.
- Avoid putting 'C', 'G', 'J', 'S' in front of 'X' to avoid confusion
  with the [*x*-system](#x-sistemo).
- Total *Epopo* alphabet: 30 letters.
  - vs Esperanto: 1 letters less (no Ĥ) and 3 letters more (QɅX)
  - vs English:  2 letters less (no WY) and 6 letters more (ŬɅĈĜĴŜ)
  - vs Pinyin:   1 consonant less (no 'Zh') and 2 consonants more (VĴ)
  - Characters  
    See also [ONKIO](ONKIO.md#onkio-tablo) for the official encoding standard.  
    `ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVŬXɅZĈĜĴŜ`  
    `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvŭxʌzĉĝĵŝ`  
    `0123456789ΔλΠΣΥΨ`  
    ``\{|}~`^@[]:;<=>?_!"#$%&'()*+⌄-—/ ‐.,``

#### x-sistemo

> `x`-system

- Similar to the [x-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitutions_of_the_Esperanto_alphabet#X-system) in Esperanto,
  *Epopo* appends *x* to *CGJS*
  to represent accented letters when forced to operate within ASCII systems.
- However, *Ŭ* is simply replaced by *W*, and *Ʌ* by *Y*.

#### -ʌ sufikso

> `-ʌ` suffix

In *Epopo*, ending a word with `-ʌ` means
that the word is a **type classifier**,
and what follows is the name of a specific thing of that type.
In other words,

- `-o` refers to a thing / a class of things;
- `-a` implies that the following thing/person
  "shares (some) characteristics of this type,
  or is located within this place, etc. etc.";
- `-ʌ` implies that the following thing/person
  "is of this type / is a member of this class";

It is important to distinguish between `-ʌ` and `-a`, i.e.
"Something is of the type" and
"Something shares the key properties of the type".

- Example 0  
  Differentiating between different word endings:

  - Mang***o*** Profesoro  
    A professor related to mangos;
    A professor who studies mangos.
  - Mang***a*** Profesoro  
    A professor who shares some of mangos' traits;
    A mango-y professor.
  - Mang***ʌ*** Profesoro  
    A mango named "Professor".

  Similarly,

  - Profesor**o** Mango  
    A mango related to professors (?)
  - Profesor**a** Mango  
    A mango who shares some of professors' traits;
    A professor-y mango.
  - Profesor**ʌ** Mango  
    A professor named "Mango".

- Example 1  
  (`Jen` in Esperanto/Epopo means "Behold")

  ```text
  Jen Urba Distriktʌ Granda-Lumturo!
  ```

  refers to a specific "urb**a** distrikt**o**" (urban district)
  that is called "Granda-Lumturo" (Great Lighthouse).  
  The equivalent in ***python*** would be

  ```python
  from context import Urba, Distrikto    # Urba is a class decorator
  this = Urba(Distrikto)(name="Granda-Lumturo")
  ```

  or more explicitly,

  ```python
  from context import Urba, Distrikto    # Urba is a class decorator
  class GrandaLumturo(Urba(Distrikto)):
      name = "Granda-Lumturo"
      types = [Urba(Distrikto)]
      unique = True
      def __init__(self, **kwargs)
          super.__init__(**kwargs)
  this = GrandaLumturo()
  ```

  And in ***Esperanto*** this would be

  ```text
  Jen la urba distrikto Granda-Lumturo!
  ```

  (though this could be a bit confusing
  whether 'Granda-Lumturo' is the name of the district,
  or a separate thing (with a forgotten coma);
  which is partly why `-ʌ` suffix is introduced in *Epopo*.)

- Example 2  
  It also works for people's titles:

  ```text
  Jen venas Ŝia Reĝina Moŝtʌ Honorinda Doktorʌ Serena Novarika.
  ```

  which means "Here comes Her Majesty the Queen, Honorable Dr Serena Novarika".
  Here, two words with `-ʌ` endings were used before "Serena Novarika";
  in this case, it means Serena is members of both class,
  i.e. She is both a Queen and a Doctor.  
  In ***python***, this would suggest multiple class inheritance:

  ```python
  from context import Ŝia, Reĝina, Moŝto, Honorinda, Doktoro
  # Ŝia, Reĝina, Honorinda are class decorators
  class SerenaNovarika(Ŝia(Reĝina(Moŝto)), Honorinda(Doktoro)):
      name = "Serena Novarika"
      types = [Ŝia(Reĝina(Moŝto)), Honorinda(Doktoro)]
      unique = True
      def __init__(self, **kwargs)
          super.__init__(**kwargs)
  this = SerenaNovarika()
  ```

- Summary and detailed rules
  1. The word ending with `-ʌ`
    must be a generic type of things when ending with `-o`;
  2. The word following (link with hyphen if having multiple words),
    except when ending with `-ʌ` or `-a` or `-e`,
    is the name of the specific thing of that type and a proper noun;
  3. The name can be a number (or letters-and-numbers-based identifier).
    In which case, that number/identifier should start with `#`.  
    E.g. 'Mt-Racia Akvobaraĵ***ʌ*** #0'.  
    (`#` symbol is not pronounced.)  
    'Mt-Racia Akvobaraĵ***o*** #0' is also okay,
    since there's few ways to misinterpret that.
  4. *Exception*: If the following word also ends with `-ʌ`,
    then it is also a class that the thing/person is a member of.
    The first proper noun after that (and after any more subsequent `-ʌ` words)
    is the name.
  5. No need to add `La` in front of the `-ʌ` ending type classifier word.
    Because we already know it refers to a specific thing just by `-ʌ` alone.  
    `La` refers to either an anonymous specific thing,
    or a specific thing with the following word as its name
    (in which case, add hyphen between `La` and the name, e.g. 'La-Pordego').
  6. The `-ʌ` ending word can often be simplified with abbreviations.
    E.g. 'Distriktʌ Lumturo' to 'Dt-Lumturo'.
    In which case, add hyphen between the abbreviation and the following name.
    Pronounce abbreviations like '**D**o**t**ʌ' to preserve word ending.
  7. See [Siglo](../OmniCentro/Sigloj.md#mallongigoj) page
    for more on abbreviations.
  8. For more information on naming things, see [Nomi](#nomi) section.

### Algebro

> Algebra

#### Apartigiloj

> Separators

Decimal separator in *Epopo* is `.` instead of `,`.

Thousands separator (decimal) / ten-thousands separator (hexadecimal) is
space(` `) instead of `.`.<!-- markdownlint-disable-line no-space-in-code -->

#### Ordaj numeraloj

> Ordinal numerals

**Ordinal numerals start from 0th** instead of 1st.

- This is akin to how numbers in arrays or sequences are referenced to
  in most modern computer codes like C or python.
  The value of ordinal number now refers to
  the cardinal number of things coming before it.  
- Examples
  - Floors start from 0th floor (ground level).
  - In a competition, the winner is 0th, and 1st comes after.
- Cardinal numbers are not affected.
  - Example:
    2 people entered a room,
    the 0th person going in is a man, and
    the 1st person going in is a woman.
  - When getting the total number from counting,
    add one to the last ordinal number counted,
    like one would do in programing.  
    Example: 0th apple, 1st, 2nd, 3rd. There are 4 apples in the basket.

#### Hekuma nombrosistemo

> Hexadecimal number system

Marking numbers as decimal ('Dekuma') or hexadecimal ('Hekuma'):

- Dekuma  (base Dx10): prefixing `Dx`, or add a subscript $?_D$;
- Hekuma  (base Dx16): prefixing `Hx`, or add a subscript $?_H$;
- Trekuma (base Dx32): prefixing `Tx`, or add a subscript $?_T$;

Built-in support for **hexadecimal algebra**:

- `Δ λ Π Σ Υ Ψ` written/pronounced as `del lom nak sig gan fus`;
- `hek`    (H) for Dx           16 (= 2^Dx4,  or Hx          10);
- `jent`   (J) for Dx          256 (= 2^Dx8,  or Hx         100);
- `gil`    (G) for Dx        4 096 (= 2^Dx12, or Hx        1000);
- `muni`   (M) for Dx       65 536 (= 2^Dx16 = Dx65536^1, or Hx      1 0000);
- `duni`   (D) for Dx4 294 967 296 (= 2^Dx32 = Dx65536^2, or Hx 1 0000 0000);
- `trini`  (T) for Dx65536^3 (= Hx10000^3 = 1pΠ);
- `hekni`  (I) for Dx65536^Dx16 (= Hx10000^Hx10 = 1p40,
  or approximately 1.158e77);
- ~~`heknia muni` for Dx65536^Dx17 (= Hx10000^Hx11 = 1p44 ≈ 7.59e81 );~~
  - Warning:
    This way to say extremely large numbers is **deprecated**
    and only listed here for technical completion reasons,
    since it would be very wordy for larger numbers such as
    `kvarnia gilnia trinia jentnia dunia heknia muni` (Hx10000^Hx4321).  
    **It is recommended to use instead [`⌄`-notation](#scienca-notacio)**
    **for extremely large or extremely small numbers.**
- `hekon`  (h) for   1/Dx16 (1p-1);
- `jenton` (j) for  1/Dx256 (1p-2);
- `gilon`  (g) for 1/Dx4096 (1p-3);
- `munion` (m) for 1/Dx65536 (1p-4);
- `dunion` (d) for 1/Dx65536^2 (1p-8);
- `trinion` (t) for 1p-Π;
- `heknion` (i) for 1p-40;
- ~~`hekniona munion` for 1p-44;~~
  - Warning: **Deprecated** for the same reason as above.
    use [`⌄`-notation](#scienca-notacio) instead for extremely large or small numbers.
- etc. etc.
- Unlike in Esperanto, in Epopo please do write numbers together for `gil`:
  E.g. `trigil`, not `tri gil`. This is done for regularity's sake.
  Only separate the two on `muni` or higher level.
- When saying numbers with more than one word,
  add `da` between them and the things they describe.  
  (This is to differentiate cases between e.g.
  ~~`jent du hekutroj`~~ (Hx1020U) and ~~`jent duhek utroj`~~ (Hx120U).)  
  E.g.
  - `jent duhek da utroj` to express Hx120U (=Dx288U);
  - `jent du da hekutroj` to express Hx1020U (=Dx4128U);
  - `jent utroj` (or 'unu jentutro') to express Hx100U (=Dx256U).
- As a reference,
  Dx 9 100 000 000 people = Hx 2 1Υ66 Ψλ00 homoj,
  pronounced as
  `du duni, gil ganjent seshek ses muni, fusgil lomjent da homoj`.
- About `-o` suffix:  
  `du muni da utroj` (and `du muniutroj`) is the acceptable way
  of saying Dx 131 072 U;  
  ~~`du munioj da utroj`~~ (like in Esperanto) is **deprecated** in *Epopo*.  
  Do not add `-o` suffix for numbers.
  Numbers are not nouns in Epopo. They are special.
- Also you can just say `du muniutroj` directly, as 1 MU = Dx65536 U.
- For fractions, add `-on` like in Esperanto. E.g. `munionutro`.
- For prefix shorthands,
  always use no-hat capital letters for numbers \> 1
  (e.g. H for Hx10 and J for Hx100 etc.)
  and no-hat lowercase for numbers \< 1
  (e.g. h for Hx0.1 and j for Hx0.01 etc.)
- For full list of prefix shorthands,
  see `u_rdo_prefixes` `dict` in [unuoj.py](unuoj.py) file.

#### Unuoj

> Units

See also [Unuoj](Unuoj.md) page.

- Unit names must not start with `O`.
  This is both to avoid confusion with 0 and with `-on` prefix suffix.
- For units shorthands (letter-based),
  always use capital letter (hat or not) as the first letter,
  and lowercase for the following letters.
  This helps to differentiate between
  the units part and prefix part of the shorthands.
  E.g. [*Lu*](Unuoj.md#potenco) would be a unit by itself,
  while *LU* would indicate the prefix 'L' (=1p38≈2.7e67)
  combined with the unit [*U*](Unuoj.md#longeco).
- Always use letter-based unit symbols for base units
  such as length ('U'), mass ('P'), time ('Ŝ'), etc.

#### Scienca notacio

> Scientific notations

`⌄`-notation:

- Similar to the [`e`-notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation)
  of the decimal system, except **both sides of `⌄` are hexadecimal**.
- `⌄` is choosen over letters for better visibility
  (and potential expansion to base Dx32/Dx64 systems
  using letters and other punctuations marks—
  See [unuoj.py](unuoj.py) `TX_SYMBOLS_DICT` and `RX_SYMBOLS_DICT`.)  
  `⌄` is easier to tell from the numbers,
  which is the main reason why it is choosen over `h` or `p`.
- E.g., `Hx 7 89Δλ ΠΣΥΨ 0000` can be shortened
  as `7.89ΔλΠΣΥΨ⌄+Π` or `7.89ΔλΠΣΥΨ⌄Π`;
- If no number follows `⌄`, assume `-2` (as 'projento').
  E.g. $3⌄ = 0.03_H = 3/256_D$
- Pronunciation:
  `pohekve` (as a short hand for `multiplikite per X-a potenco de hek`).  
  E.g. The Avogadro's number — approximately `7.Ψ86⌄13` —
  can be pronounced as `Sep punkto fus ok ses pohekve hek tri`,  
  which in itself is a shorthand for
  `Sep punkto fus ok ses multiplikite per hek-tria potenco de hek`.

### Interpunkcio

> Punctuation

- '‐' (Hyphen) and '-' (Minus)
  - Differentiate between hyphen (linking words)
    and minus (subtracting numbers).  
    This is to help computer code differentiate variable names and operations.
  - Use hyphen to string up words inside Proper Names.
- ~~'–' (En dash)~~  
  En dash is *cancelled* in Epopo.  
  When needing to use an en dash, use the below instead:
  - use a '\~' (tilde with *no* surrounding space, though this is not strict)
    to connect *numbers* representing ranges.  
    E.g.
    "During 2024\~2025, the city finished its planning phase."  
    Or
    "The temperature fluctuates around -42°C\~-3°C."
  - use a ' \~ ' (tilde with surrounding spaces)
    to connect *words* that representing ranges.  
    E.g.
    "Serena's Coronation ~ Her first anniversary:
    the dam finished construction."
  - use '--' (double hyphen with *no* surrounding space)
    to connect multi-words adjectives.
    Remember to string up those multi-words adjectives with '‐' (single hyphen),
    so readers are not confused with how many words exactly are concerned.  
    E.g. "She is a brilliant Nobel‐prize--winning scientist."
- '—' (Em dash)
  - **Add spaces around em dash when using them in pairs.**  
    I.e. when you are coming back to the main sentence,
    or if what comes later is conceptually separate from the main.  
    The surrounding spaces are to help markdown formatting,
    as this allows splitting lines around em dash.  
    E.g.  
    "Serena — arriving at her new just-completed palace for the first time —
    snaps her fingers in the grand hall and says, 'Let there be light.'"
  - **Add one trailing space after the em dash for single use occasions.**  
    I.e. when you are just adding extra details to the main sentence
    (or just marking a change in tone etc),
    and you are not planning to go back to the main sentence.  
    E.g.  
    "He is suprised— despite their trusting relationship,
    Ĝejda usually isn't this much amenable towards
    his many (admittedly questionable) ideas."
    - When the following is a direct explanation of the phrase before,
      *consider using colon ':' instead of em dash '—'.*  
      E.g.
      "The book: an explanation on Epopo's history"
  - **Use two em dashes ('——') with surrounding spaces to indicate author/origin of a quote.**  
    E.g.  
    "The truth springs from arguments amongst friends." —— David Hume.  
    Or  <br>
    <blockquote>
      They enslave their children's children who make compromise with sin.<br>
      <span style="color:grey">
      —— <cite><a href="https://poets.org/poem/present-crisis">
        The Present Crisis</a></cite> by James Russell Lowell
      </span>
    </blockquote>

> Proper Names for places

- Basic Format: e.g. `Sc-Granda-Lumturo`,  
  as a short hand of `Staciʌ Granda-Lumturo`,
  which generally refers to `Stacio de Dt-Granda-Lumturo`,
  i.e. `Stacio de Distriktʌ Granda-Lumturo`
  - Start the name with the abbreviated 2\~4-letter *type classifier*
    listed in [Sigloj](../OmniCentro/Sigloj.md#mallongigoj) page.
    (See there for some examples also.)  
  - If the Proper Name have multiple word,
    string them up with *hyphens*.  
  - Examples:
    - 'Mt-Espero' as a name for a mountain;
    - 'La-Kora-Tereno' as a name for a building;
      <!-- Domo de la Arkitekto kaj la Ĉefinĝeniero-->
    - 'Dt-Granda-Lumturo' as a name for a district;
    - 'Sc-Granda-Lumturo' as the name for the transit hub in that district.
  - Always add *type classifier* in front of the name of the place/thing,
    so it is clear that what follows is a name of a place/thing,
    instead of whatever things the name itself point to.  
    - e.g. in 'Distriktʌ Granda-Lumturo', we know
      'Granda-Lumturo' is the name of a district called 'Granda-Lumturo',
      instead of
      refering to a place that is a 'granda lumturo' (big lighthouse).
    - *Exceptions*: Unique names that are clear
      that it can only refer to that specific place/thing,
      such as most cities and countries names.
      e.g. 'OmniCentra RadioReto' is enough,
      no need for 'Ub-OmniCentra RadioReto',
      because we already know that
      'OmniCentro' is and can only be referring to a specific city.  
      Note: Here 'OmniCentra' ends with '-a' instead of '-ʌ',
      because 'OmniCentro' is not a generic type of things,
      but a specific city.
  - No need to add 'La' in front of 'Dt' or 'Sc' etc type classifier.
    Because it can already be infered that the phrase is pointing towards
    a specific place even without the definite article 'La'.
- Extended Format: e.g. `Dt-Granda-Lumtura Hospitalo`  
  as a short hand of `Distriktʌ Granda-Lumtura Hospitalo`.
  - Using 'Dt-Granda-Lumtura' as a locational indicator
    to describe the location of the noun ('Stacio').  
  - Add hyphen within words of single conceptual elements,
    especially if the word is not itself the name of a place.
    This is so people know that in e.g. 'Stacio de Distriktʌ Granda-Lumturo',
    'Granda' is part of the name of a place called 'Granda-Lumturo',
    instead of 'Granda' as an adjective
    describing the 'Stacio' or 'Lumturo' as 'Granda' (Big).
  - Do not do this with stations; just use the 'Sc' prefix in the Basic Format.
    Stations are common enough places to deserve its own type classifier.

### Sekso

> Gender

- Pronouns
  - `li` is now gender-neutral
    (its old meaning of 'he' has been removed,
    leaving only 'them (singular)' alone);
  - `hi` now means 'he' (third person who is male);
  - `ŝi` remains meaning 'she' (third person who is female).
  - It is encouraged to use `li` in scenarios
    where sex is unknown/unspecified/explicitly-required-to-be-irrelevant,
    such as workplaces.
    Consider using `hi`/`ŝi` in most other situations,
    especially in causal conversations or romance novels
    to perserve information.
    This is more of a guideline than a rule.
- All nouns are now gender-neutral by default,
  unless added surfix `-in-` for female and `-iĉ-` for male.
  - E.g., `viro` is replaced by `viriĉo` for man,
    and `virino` remains to be woman.
