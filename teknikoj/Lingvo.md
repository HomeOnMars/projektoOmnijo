Epopo

> [Back to OmniCentro Content](../OmniCentro.md#detalaj-informoj)

The official language in [RdO](Bulteno.md#fonrakonta-bulteno) is
***Esperanto++*** (often written as `E++` or `Epopo`),
a fictional variant of L. L. Zamenhof's artificial language
[*Esperanto*](https://lernu.net/esperanto) (1887),
with multiple changes specified by
<span style="color:Beige">Reĝino Serena</span> herself,
aiming to offer even more regularity and inclusivity,
while conforming to the existing world as much as possible.[^Lingvo-Historio-1]
<span style="color:Beige">Queen Serena</span> declared `Epopo`
as the new official language of RdO about three months in her reign,
set to gradually replace English in the next *hekjaro* (hexcade, i.e. 16 years)
in all RdO official documentations and communications.

[^Lingvo-Historio-1]: Contrary to what one might expect,
  Many Esperantists are not really big fans of the Queen breaking the
  traditions of their language unilaterally with the big big changes she made…

One would think that such random policy
is surely going to cause massive civil unrest,
but by that time the people have already gotten used to the
<span style="color:Beige">Queen</span>'s ridiculous style;
plus, they also have the chaotic implementation of
her new UBI (universal basic income) policy to worry about.

Changes of Esperanto++ from Esperanto include:

### Alfabeto

> Alphabet

- Officially eliminated `Ĥ` from the *Epopo* alphabet
  (mostly replaced with `K`);
- Adding `Q` (Q), `X` (X), `Ʌ` (ü) for more diverse sounds,
  inspired by [pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin).  
  No words from *Epopo* are using those three letters yet;
  for now they are only used in naming.
- Total *Epopo* alphabet: 30 letters.
  - vs Esperanto: 1 letters less (no Ĥ) and 3 letters more (QɅX)
  - vs English:  2 letters less (no WY) and 6 letters more (ɅŬĈĜĴŜ)
  - vs Pinyin:   1 consonant less (no 'Zh') and 2 consonants more (VĴ)
  - Characters

- `w`-system
  - Instead of the [X-system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitutions_of_the_Esperanto_alphabet#X-system) in Esperanto,
    *Epopo* appends *w* instead of *x* to *CGJSUV*
    to represent accented letters or Ʌ in ASCII,
    since *x* is a real letter in *Epopo* as well.
  - *w* was used instead of *y* because it fits my intuition better
    how it would change the sound of the letter.

### Algebro

> Algebra

- Decimal separator in *Epopo* is `.` instead of `,`;<br>
  Thousands separator (decimal) / ten-thousands separator (hexadecimal) is
  space(` `) instead of `.`;<!-- markdownlint-disable-line no-space-in-code -->
- Marking numbers as decimal ('Dekuma') or hexadecimal ('Hekuma'):
  - Dekuma  (base Dx10): prefixing `Dx`, or add a subscript $?_D$;
  - Hekuma  (base Dx16): prefixing `Hx`, or add a subscript $?_H$;
  - Trekuma (base Dx32): prefixing `Tx`, or add a subscript $?_T$;
- Built-in support for *hexadecimal* algebra:
  - `Δ λ Π Σ Υ Ψ` written/pronounced as `del lom nak sig gan fus`;
  - `hek`    (H) for Dx           16 (= 2^Dx4,  or Hx          10);
  - `jent`   (J) for Dx          256 (= 2^Dx8,  or Hx         100);
  - `gil`    (G) for Dx        4 096 (= 2^Dx12, or Hx        1000);
  - `muni`   (M) for Dx       65 536 (= 2^Dx16 = Dx65536^1, or Hx      1 0000);
  - `duni`   (D) for Dx4 294 967 296 (= 2^Dx32 = Dx65536^2, or Hx 1 0000 0000);
  - `trini`  (T) for Dx65536^3 (= Hx10000^3 = 1pΠ);
  - `hekni`  (I) for Dx65536^Dx16 (= Hx10000^Hx10 = 1p40,
    or approximately 1.158e77);
  - ~~`heknia muni` for Dx65536^Dx17 (= Hx10000^Hx11 = 1p44 ≈ 7.59e81 );~~
    - Warning:
      This way to say extremely large numbers is **deprecated**
      and only listed here for technical completion reasons,
      since it would be very wordy for larger numbers such as
      `kvarnia gilnia trinia jentnia dunia heknia munio` (Hx10000^Hx4321).  
      **It is recommended to use instead `p`-notation**
      **for extremely large or extremely small numbers.**
  - `hekon`  (h) for   1/Dx16 (1p-1);
  - `jenton` (j) for  1/Dx256 (1p-2);
  - `gilon`  (g) for 1/Dx4096 (1p-3);
  - `munion` (m) for 1/Dx65536 (1p-4);
  - `dunion` (d) for 1/Dx65536^2 (1p-8);
  - `trinion` (t) for 1p-Π;
  - `heknion` (i) for 1p-40;
  - ~~`hekniona munion` for 1p-44;~~
    - Warning: **Deprecated** for the same reason as above.
      use `p`-notation instead for extremely large or small numbers.
  - etc. etc.
  - When saying one `hek`, one `jent`, or one `gil`,
    always add prefix `u` to signify it as a number instead of a unit.  
    E.g., say `ujent uhek` to express Hx110 (=Dx272);  
    say `dujent uhek utroj` to express Hx210U (=Dx528U).  
    This is to differentiate cases between e.g.
    ~~`jent hekutroj`~~ (should be said as `ujent hekutroj`)
    and ~~`jent hek utroj`~~ (should be said as `ujent uhek utroj`).
  - As a reference,
    Dx 9 100 000 000 = Hx 2 1Υ66 Ψλ00,
    pronounced as
    `du duni, ugil ganjent seshek ses muni, fusgil lomjent`.
  - When saying one `muni`, one `duni`, etc, always add `unu` in front of it.
  - Both `unu munio da utroj` and `unu muni utroj`
    are acceptable ways of saying Dx 65 536 U.
  - Also you can just say `unu muniutro` directly, as 1 MU = Dx65536 U.
  - For fractions, add `-on` like in Esperanto. E.g. `munionutro`.
  - For prefix shorthands,
    always use no-hat capital letters for numbers \> 1
    (e.g. H for Hx10 and J for Hx100 etc.)
    and no-hat lowercase for numbers \< 1
    (e.g. h for Hx0.1 and j for Hx0.01 etc.)
  - For full list of prefix shorthands,
    see `u_rdo_prefixes` `dict` in [unuoj.py](unuoj.py) file.
  - Unit names must not start with `O`.
    This is both to avoid confusion with 0 and with `-on` prefix suffix.
  - For units shorthands (letter-based),
    always use capital letter (hat or not) as the first letter,
    and lowercase for the following letters.
    This helps to differentiate between
    the units part and prefix part of the shorthands.
    E.g. [*Lu*](Unuoj.md#potenco) would be a unit by itself,
    while *LU* would indicate the prefix 'L' (=1p38≈2.7e67)
    combined with the unit [*U*](Unuoj.md#longeco).
  - Always use letter-based unit symbols for base units
    such as length ('U'), mass ('P'), time ('Ŝ'), etc.
- `p`-notation:
  - Similar to the [`e`-notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation#E_notation)
    of the decimal system, except **both sides of `p` are hexadecimal**.
  - `p` must be lower case for better visibility,
    i.e. easier to tell it from the numbers.
    `p` is chosen over `h` or other letters for exactly this reason.
  - E.g., `Hx 7 89Δλ ΠΣΥΨ 0000` can be shortened
    as `7.89ΔλΠΣΥΨp+Π` or `7.89ΔλΠΣΥΨpΠ`;
  - Pronunciation:
    TBD.

### Interpunkcio

> Punctuation

- '‐' (Hyphen) and '-' (Minus)
  - Differentiate between hyphen (linking words)
    and minus (subtracting numbers).  
    This is to help computer code differentiate variable names and operations.
  - Use hyphen to string up words inside Proper Names.
- ~~'–' (En dash)~~  
  En dash is cancelled in Epopo.  
  When needing to use an en dash, use the below instead:
  - use a ' ‐ ' (hyphen with surrounding space)
    to connect numbers representing ranges.  
    E.g. "During 2024 - 2025, the city finished its planning phase."
  - use '—' (Em dash with *no* surrounding space)
    to connect multi-words adjectives.
    Remember to string up those multi-words adjectives with '‐' (hyphen),
    so readers are not confused with how many words exactly are concerned.  
    E.g. "She is a brilliant Nobel‐prize—winning scientist."
- '—' (Em dash)
  - **Add spaces around em dash**.  
    This is to help markdown formatting
    (allowing splitting lines around em dash.)
  - Use two em dashes ('——') with trailing space
    to indicate author/origin of a quote.  
    E.g.
    <blockquote>
      They enslave their children's children who make compromise with sin.<br>
      <span style="color:grey">
      —— <cite><a href="https://poets.org/poem/present-crisis">
        The Present Crisis</a></cite> by James Russell Lowell
      </span>
    </blockquote>

- Library of Unicode Punctuation Marks
  - ~~“‘Quotes’”~~
    (Use ASCII/ONKIO quotation marks instead within this repo,
    for easier whole word searches in vscode.)
  - … Horizontal Ellipsis
    (Use Unicode symbol instead of three separate dots.)
  - ≈ Approx

### Nomi

> Naming things

- Proper Names (for places)
  - Format 1: e.g. `Sc-Granda-Lumturo`  
    Start the name with the abbreviated 2\~4-letter *type classifier*
    listed in [Sigloj](../OmniCentro/Sigloj.md#mallongigoj) page.
    (See there for some examples also.)  
    If the Proper Name have multiple word,
    string them up with *hyphens*.  
    Examples:
    - 'Mt-Espero' as a name for a mountain;
    - 'La-Kora-Tereno' as a name for a building;
      <!-- Domo de la Arkitekto kaj la Ĉefinĝeniero-->
    - 'Dt-Granda-Lumturo' as a name for a district;
    - 'Sc-Granda-Lumturo' as the name for the transit hub in that district.
      Alternatively, 'Dt-Granda-Lumtura Stacio' works too.  
      This is because 'Dt-Granda-Lumtura' is one single conceptual element
      refering to the district, and 'Stacio' as something located within it.
  - Format 2: e.g. `Granda-Lumtura Distrikta Stacio`  
    Spell out everything as 'natural language'.  
    Add hyphen within words of single conceptual elements,
    especially if the word is not itself the name of a place.
    This is so people know that in e.g. 'Granda-Lumtura Distrikta Stacio',
    'Granda' is part of the name of a place called 'Granda-Lumturo',
    instead of
    'Granda' as an adjective describing the 'Stacio' as 'Granda' (Big).

### Sekso

> Gender

- Pronouns
  - `li` is now gender-neutral
    (its old meaning of 'he' has been removed,
    leaving only 'them (singular)' alone);
  - `hi` now means 'he' (third person who is male);
  - `ŝi` remains meaning 'she' (third person who is female).
  - It is encouraged to use `li` in scenarios
    where sex is unknown/unspecified/explicitly-required-to-be-irrelevant,
    such as workplaces.
    Consider using `hi`/`ŝi` in most other situations,
    especially in causal conversations or romance novels
    to perserve information.
    This is more of a guideline than a rule.
- All nouns are now gender-neutral by default,
  unless added surfix `-in-` for female and `-iĉ-` for male.
  - E.g., `viro` is replaced by `viriĉo` for man,
    and `virino` remains to be woman.
- See also [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_reform_in_Esperanto#Common_elements_to_regularizing_Esperanto_gender).

### Tempo

> Time

- Units and *`Omnijaro`* Calendar System (Ø+\* years)  
  See also the [Units](../teknikoj/Unuoj.md#tempo) page for explanation, and the
  [(*Spoilers*) Timeline](../intrigmalkaswo/Kronologio.md#kronologio) page
  for usage.

  | Siglo | Formo   | Nomo           |
  | --- | --------- | -------------- |
  | `Ĝ` | `Ĝoro`    | Omnija horo    |
  | `Ĉ` | `Ĉimuto`  | Omnija minuto  |
  | `Ŝ` | `Ŝekunto` | Omnija sekundo |

- Name for the months
