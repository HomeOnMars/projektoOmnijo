Ø-3⚝ | 3 weeks before Serena's Coronation, the old Capital,
the Old King's residence, kitchen.

“Let’s cut to the chase; you are wondering why I even exist —
when you never had unprotected sex with my mother.”
Serena declares, as her sharp gray eyes locks fearlessly onto with his.

An obvious question with an obvious answer, the King thinks bitterly.
It’s so obvious in hindsight that
he wonders what takes himself and General Natasha so long to think of this move.
People thinks he is getting old, slow, and forgetful,
and increasingly desires a replacement — a
young, attractive, unthreatening, and easily manipulatable replacement.
Put her out there in the public so no one can ignore her,
then wait for him to die — better yet, remove him now and speed things along.
Boom, Natasha gets her puppet Queen,
pushes through that fat environment-destroying
scenery-ruining foreign mining deal,
and finally becomes the real ruler of the island,
as she removes the only opposition left in the government — him.

He almost wants to applaud her for thinking of this. Almost.

“Tea?” he says, with a smile perfectly practiced after decades of rule.
Pretending to be friendly had long ago become second nature.

“No, thanks,” says Serena, gracefully pushing the cup of tea aside.

The Old King watches her hands — steady, deliberate. So beautiful, he thinks.
Not in a crude way, but in a way that unravels him,
just like her alleged mother did 19 years ago. Anna.
His old flame, and perhaps the only person he truly loved without reservation.
He was already King back then,
but still young enough to believe he could keep both the crown and her,
a delusion lasted right up until his enemies caught the wind of it.
As the press swarmed their little love nest, he left,
thinking he was saving her. Maybe he did — but it didn’t save him.

Serena looks nothing like Anna.
And yet, something in the way she sits — her posture, her presence — makes
his brain uncontrollably want to label her as *younger Anna*.
A younger, idealized echo; not the real woman,
but a memory turned flesh.
He couldn't help but feel the surge of warmth, affection,
and an almost paternal protectiveness rising in him[^K1].

[^K1]: In a few years,
when he looks back on this moment, he’ll call it what it was:
*Adversarial Brain Hacking* —
the biological equivalent of
[Adversarial Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning).
The same way you trick an AI with carefully calibrated pixels,
you trick a human brain with a carefully calibrated face —
personalized just for him.
But today’s king doesn’t even know such thing is even a possibility;
so when his brain searched for a possible explanation, it returned nothing,
so he thought of nothing,
as he quickly lost track of his thought on this anyway.

Maybe… maybe she really *is* Anna’s daughter. A miracle. His blood.
Maybe he doesn’t have to do what he must do next.

The king forces his eyes away from her. *Stop.*
Miracles might happen in real life — but they never happen to *you*.
Putting his life — and the whole kingdom’s future — on miracles
would be the worst case of wishful thinking, and the king is no fool.
Natasha had made her move; now, he has to make his.
Such a shame for Serena — she won’t even know why.

“Hmm,” he says, voice light.
“How about a cocktail instead? I hear you turned eighteen this year.
Not many can say a King personally mixed their drinks.”
He smiles, warm and harmless; the mask fits so well it almost feels real.
Only his eyes betray the glint of tears he will not let fall.

“If you so wish, Your Highness,” Serena says,
watching the Old King take out a pristine glass
and begin blending ingredients with a kind of regal awkwardness.

*She’s so graceful,* the King thinks,
carefully averting her attention from
the subtle marking on the cupboard — the one
marking the glasses reserved only for *“special occasions”* like this one.
Every motion of hers calls Anna to mind.
Nineteen years have passed, but he still remembers her as if it were yesterday:
radiant, elusive, fierce beneath the softness,
and a backbone of iron wrapped in silk.

*He misses her. God, he misses her.*

But it’s all too late now.

Serena echoes Anna in the strangest, most infuriating ways.
Earlier today — during the ceremony,
when dignitaries still filled this very room — she had accidentally
knocked over that absurdly expensive vase in the corner.
The one gifted by the ambassador of their biggest trade partner — the one
Natasha had personally handled and *insisted* be kept here “for safekeeping.”
Serena hadn’t flinched. She smiled, apologized without lowering her eyes,
defusing the tension like a seasoned diplomat. Like Anna would have.
And the Old King hadn’t minded;
not really, as the vase was almost certainly bugged.
Now, he had an excuse to throw it out.

*Maybe,* he thinks,
*she really could have been a proper Queen — if she’d had more time...*
He shakes that thought off from his head. *Best not to get distracted.*

“I’m not with General Natasha, you know,” Serena says softly,
her voice empathetic but with hidden gravitas. “I’m not your enemy.”

“Of course not. Why would you say such a thing, my dearest?”
the Old King replies, slipping on his most paternal tone.
It’s easier than it should be, real even, under her presence.
But she’s not the first to say such things.
Beautiful women, clever advisers, even childhood friends —
they all said it once.
And time and time again, it ends in *betrayal*.

*Better to betray first. While you still can.*

“It’s done!” the King declares cheerfully, sliding the cocktail toward her.
“Try it?”

Serena doesn’t move at first. She just looks at him.
There’s something in her eyes: not anger, not fear, but something quieter.
Resignation. Empathy. A tired kind of understanding — like
someone who knows what’s coming and still hopes, foolishly,
for a different ending.

She lifts both glasses — the cocktail, and the untouched tea — and
calmly empties them into the sink.
“Your Majesty,” she says gently,
“if I may — you should be more careful leaving these around.
What if you forget what you’ve done,
and accidentally drink them after I’m gone?”
She sets the glasses down with care.
*“Believe it or not, I actually prefer you alive. And happy.”*

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The old king stares at Serena.
The smile he wears is still there, though no longer lively.
For just a second or two, his face is frozen-
like he forget how to move his face muscles.

Then the light went back into his eyes.
When you are this old and experienced, you likely have seen it all-
if not exactly the same thing, at least something similar.
This is no exception.

“You think the drinks are poisoned? By *me*? Why would you say such a thing?
You know I wouldn’t do that to you, honey…”
the old king says, as he moves towards the counter.
No point in lying to someone who clearly knows more than you do-
unless you know you are being watched.
In times of uncertainties, plausible deniability is king.
Plus, he needs to buy time.

“*Oh*, why don’t we skip this phrase and drop the pretense already.
Natasha is not listening in to our conversations anymore;
when I ‘accidentally’ break the vase,
I destroyed the listening bug hidden in it too. That was not an accident.”

“There is more than one bug in this house.”
The king says with a weird dry smile,
as he silently reaches out to the hidden item underneath the counter.

“All 47 of them have been disabled at that moment too —
when her technicians check the record,
they will find a rare software bug knocking out the whole network,
triggered by the failure of the vase one.” Serena explains, “honestly,
I would suggest to increase the security of your house and your staff-
it’s way too easy to infiltrate.”

It’s not like he doesn’t know that already.

“It’s not that simple,” the king says.
*She is still too young to understand all the traps*
*and treacherousness of politics.*
“Natasha will start a military coup immediately if I do that.
The only reason that she hasn’t done that already is
because the cost outweight the benefits.”
The King explains patiently, with his hands moving under concealment.
“Chaos follows conflicts,
and she knows I am going to die soon-ish because of my old age anyway.
It won't worth it as long as I am not a credible threat;
and she knows I am not, exactly because she hears everything I plans.”
It’s hard to gain back agency when you are pinned down and have no bullets.
The king eyes towards Serena’s position, and sighs.
Things are going to get messy.

“Whatever. I know you don’t believe what I said, nor do you trust me yet,
but I promise that *I am not your enemy*. I meant it.
So if you could please stop doing this…” She says,
as she feels the wind of the flying knife kissing the side of her cheek,
leaving a tiny linear scar of red. Serena didn’t even blink.

That knife is merely a distraction.
The king planned and practiced this move long ago;
he never thought he one day would have to actually use it on a real person.
Still, the kingdom *must* be protected *at all costs*.
As he thrown the first knife with deadly precision,
the second knife is already in his hands, when he steps towards the other side-
the side where people usually doge towards and losing balance in the process-
and strikes, at exactly where the neck and its arterial will be.
Quick, silent, painless.
His hand moves with precision,
as his eyes tracks Serena with ice cold determination-
the same cold determination that keeps him alive and motivated
over all those years, as he stares Serena in her eyes.
Her crystal clear eyes.

*So clear, so innocent, so vulnerable…*
*What am I doing? Is this really justified?*
*Do I really give a damn about the kingdom, when it’s her life on the line…*
*Stop. This feels wrong. I am wrong. Stop. Stop stop stop* ***stop Stop STOP!***

He couldn’t do it.

The second knife stops barely touching Serena’s arterial,
as the King’s hand freezes midway in the most awkward way imaginable.

Serena didn’t break her eye contact even once.
She didn’t even try to doge the first knife,
which conveniently means that she avoided having her arterial sliced open
by the second knife just in time.
With that second knife still kissing her neck,
Serena speaks in a perfectly calm voice
that is so out of character for someone who just turned 18:
“… like I said, if you could stop trying to kill me,
maybe we could work out an actual solution for the Kingdom.
Have a nice chat, and maybe even save everyone.”
She looks at the old king, who is now frozen in place,
drowning in his own internal conflicts.

The King stares her in the eyes for a while, and then says with a bitter smile:
“I don’t even know who you are anymore.”

“Someone new on the chess board.” Serena says,
as she feels the pressure on her neck disappears
with the king moving away the knife-
not all the way, it’s still centimeters away from her,
strike-able within a fraction of a second.

*Good enough.*

She maintains her perfectly calm manner, as if the knife doesn’t matter;
and it doesn’t matter indeed.
“You don’t want to risk being recorded.
That’s all right; I too love plausible deniability.
So, let me ask your questions out loud for you:
you are thinking, how could I go beyond my designated role of the new prop Queen
and stop the on-going tragedies — particularly with
the new foreign mining deal that General Natasha is about to push through —
when you, many others, and even *Natasha herself*
have tried hard but failed?[^K2]”

[^K2]: How she knows about the posion and the knife is less relevant here,
as both Serena and the King expects Natasha to know most of his fallback plans.
That alone wouldn't matter much to the King, with his
[Swiss Cheese Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_cheese_model)-based
planning. So Serena opted to first convince the King that
valid alternative options actually exists,
before he goes for his third plan against her;
and it's working.

Serena can see the King's eyebrow raises as he hears that last sentence.
A good sign.

“I hope me being this composed and resilent even under violent physical threats
can at least provide you with some reassurance of my competence, your majesty.”
Serena says dryly, with her eyes
gesturing towards the knife that is still hanging near her neck,
without any hints of fear showing on her face.
“As for my heart…
we both know the kingdom is wrapped in corruption and broken power structures.
I feel your pain too, and I aim to fix that.”

“Do you, now?” the King lets out an tired laugh,
as he further lower down his knife. It’s still in his hand, just in case;
After all, from what she said, she is either a genius or a delusional madwoman.
The odds suggests the later.
And the competent but delusional ones are the worst kind.

But he is also old and cornered, politically speaking.
Let’s see what this one has to say.
“What exactly do you think the problems of our island are?
And how would you plan to fix those?”
His eye skims through the royal clock hanging on the wall,
“Acutally, for the sake of our limited time, let's keep the question small:
Why do you think we have so many land-based soldiers on this remote island,
when the nearest land is Antarctica 2000km away?
And how exactly do you plan to deal with them?”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When Serena is about to leave, the King asks her:
“For curiosity’s sake, answer me one last question.
Why do you want the throne to begin with?
You certainly know the consequences attached to it.
Why not leave too, and have a normal life elsewhere?”

Serena leans back. With her gray eyes firmly meeting with his,
and a quiet but steady tone, she states:
“The same reason why you, Natasha, or anyone wants power.
Generally speaking, regardless of your drive or intention —
selfishness, altruism, domination, pacifism, fear, hate, desire,
power, fame, money, survival, protection, vision, or anything really —
[*without power, you can affect nothing*](https://youtu.be/rStL7niR7gs?t=1068).”

“And you think the position of the Queen would be *enough*?”
says the King with an sarcastic undertone,
gesturing towards himself with a bitter smile.

“I know it’s not.” for a brief moment, Serena smiles back to the King —
not her usual smile, the one constantly on her face outside this room
in the past few days; but a calmer, clearer, and more sincere one,
filled with resoution.
“But *it will be a good start*.”

Serena curtsies to the King one last time, and when she stands back up,
the usual enthusiasm of a newly-discovered royal young adult
is already back in her posture.
As she gracefully walks past his trusted butler while leaving the room,
the king sighs, and calls in the butler
who’s still gazing at Serena's back silhouette with a subtly sad expression.

“Change of plans. I need you to do the following…”
