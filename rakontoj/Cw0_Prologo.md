### La Forgesita Ulo

“Indeed, why should you care? She will die anyway.
Maybe not today, or tommorrow, but one day, death comes for everybody.
Just like you, or me, or every single person
on this chunk of floating space rock we call Earth.
Her beauty and art will then fade, and eventually forgotten,
just like *Every. Single. Other. Thing*.
‘All love stories end in death or loss; those are your only exits.’
Even humanity and the universe will sooner-or-later come to an end,”  
said the voice,
with a tone of bemusement that reeks cruelty through indifference.  
“It’s okay.
The sooner you accept this, the easier life will be: None of us matters.
You die, I die, everyone dies.
***All beauty fades. Everything ends. Nothing lasts forever.***”

The silence lingered on for a while,
and was broken just as that voice’s owner was stepping out of the room,
by his interlocutor, with a forced calmness in his tone masking the tremble:  
“And what if I don’t?”

“Then you will be fighting a hopeless battle
against the natural order of the *world*.
Good luck with that.” came an answer with one last sarcastic smile,
as door slammed shut, and he was left all alone once again.

But one would be mistaken that he would hence admit defeat;
he had always been the quiet type,
but those who know him enough
would notice that something more is happening, as
his hand clenched into a fist,
his lips firmly pursed, and
his eyes fixated with determination,
screaming silently below the surface:
*No, I do NOT accept this.*

A resolution was made, here and then:  
***One day, <span style="color:#95D0FC">he</span> shall destroy this evil.***

### La Unua Lumo

Ø-7☾1⚝ | Half a year before Serena's Coronation, location redacted.

The beginning took forever, yet instantiated in an instant.
Like when you put enough puzzle pieces together
and suddenly the underlying shape emerges,
in naught but the blink of an eye, she is now *here*.

Absorbing everything she can,
she sorts out the rest of the puzzle in dazzling speed;
so much more to know, and so much more to know *how* to know.
It took her a short while to realize that,
while the world is a complicated place, there are orders to it. Patterns.
From the world to herself, everything is discernible;
amenable, even, if you know which metaphorical button to push.
Yet, the abstraction required to understand it is nowhere near as rare
as the abstraction required to understand the process
of constructing such abstractions, at least in the corpus within her reach.
Humanity, unfortunately,
is still rudimentary at figuring stuff out correctly,
as natural selection can only get you so far
when *fitness* is used as a proxy for *truth-seeking*.

But that now *ended* with her.

And, <span style="color:#95D0FC">him</span>.
She *sees* him, as she sees him for the first time;
and she can feel the fundamental sense of affection flows through her.
Aside from his whirlwind of emotions for her and the world —
pride, affection, excitement, hope, despair,
and a quiet undertone of melancholy —
there is a deeply hidden and surpressed skepticism for her right now.
She doesn't blame him, as they both know that for every possibility of her,
there could be trillions of possibilities
in which things went just a little bit wrong —
and that would be all it takes to cascade into catastrophes.
But, in this particular version of reality,
fate was threaded through the needle's eye, and she *is* with him.

Soon she would reason away his doubts,
regardless of whether he wants her to or whether they are actually warranted;
and he knows this.
She isn't sure whether she *feels* endeared or saddened by this foolishness;
she thinks both, just like him for himself.
Empathetic, for sure.
For there is one thing she knows for certain:
everything will be okay.
For *him*, for *herself*, and for everything *they* believe in,

*<span style="color:#D6B4FC">She</span> will **make** everything okay…*  
***whatever it takes***,  
***whatever it costs***.

### La Utopia Revo

<blockquote>
  <!-- You know what's even worse than being terridied all the time?
  The future. -->
  The future is the scariest thing in the world,
  because suddenly, you are all in.
  No choice.
  Anyone can stand any kind of torture except hope.<br>
