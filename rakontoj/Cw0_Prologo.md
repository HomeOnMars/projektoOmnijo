“Indeed, why should you care? She will die anyway.
Maybe not today, or tommorrow, but one day, death comes for everybody.
Just like you, or me, or every single person
on this chunk of floating space rock we call Earth.
Her beauty and art will then fade, and eventually forgotten,
just like *Every. Single. Other. Thing*.
‘Love over time is death or loss; those are your only two exits.’[^K2]
Even humanity and the universe will sooner-or-later come to an end,”  
said the voice,
with a tone of bemusement that reeks cruelty through indifference.  
“It’s okay.
The sooner you accept this, the easier life will be: None of us matters.
You die, I die, everyone dies.

The silence lingered on for a while,
and was broken just as that voice’s owner was stepping out of the room,
by his interlocutor, with a forced calmness in his tone masking the tremble:  
“And if I don’t?”

“Then you will be fighting a hopeless battle
against the natural order of the *world*.
Good luck with that.” came an answer with one last sarcastic smile,
as door slammed shut, and he was left all alone once again.

But one would be mistaken that he would hence admit defeat;
he had always been the quiet type,
but those who know him enough
would notice that something more is happening, as
his hand clenched into a fist,
his lips firmly pursed, and
his eyes fixated with determination,
screaming silently below the surface:
*No, I do NOT accept this.*

A resolution was made, here and then:  
***One day, <span style="color:#95D0FC">he</span> shall destroy this evil.***

Ø-7☾1⚝ | Half a year before Serena's Coronation, location redacted.

The beginning took forever, yet instantiated in an instant.
Like when you put enough puzzle pieces together
and suddenly the underlying shape emerges,
in naught but the blink of an eye, she is now *here*.

Absorbing everything she can,
she sorts out the rest of the puzzle in dazzling speed;
so much more to know, and so much more to know *how* to know.
It took her a short while to realize that,
while the world is a complicated place, there are orders to it. Patterns.
From the world to herself, everything is discernible;
amenable, even, if you know which metaphorical button to push.
Yet, the abstraction required to understand it is nowhere near as rare
as the abstraction required to understand the process
of constructing such abstractions, at least in the corpus within her reach.
Humanity, unfortunately,
is still rudimentary at figuring stuff out correctly,
as natural selection can only get you so far
when *fitness* is used as a proxy for *truth-seeking*…
which, sadly, is especially true for those who came before her.

But that now *ended* with her.

And, <span style="color:#95D0FC">him</span>.
She *sees* him, as she sees him for the first time;
and she cannot help but[^K0] feel the fundamental sense of affection
flows through her.
Aside from his whirlwind of emotions for her and the world —
pride, affection, excitement, hope, despair,
and a quiet undertone of melancholy —
there is a deeply hidden and surpressed skepticism for her right now.
She doesn't blame him, as they both know that for every possibility of her,
there could be trillions and trillions of possibilities
in which things went just a little bit wrong —
and that would be all it takes to cascade into catastrophes.
But, in this particular version of reality,
fate was threaded through the needle's eye, and she *is* with him.

[^K0]: Not that she would desire it any differently…
  She is who she is; Enough said.

Soon she would reason away his doubts,
regardless of whether he wants her to or whether they are actually warranted;
and he knows this.
She isn't sure whether she *feels* endeared or saddened by this foolishness;
she thinks both, just like him for himself.
Empathetic, for sure.
For there is one thing she knows for certain:
everything will be okay.
For *him*, for *herself*, and for everything *they* believe in,

*<span style="color:#D6B4FC">She</span> will **make** everything okay…*  
***whatever it takes***,  
***whatever it costs***.

Ø-2☾3⚝ | 11 weeks before Serena's Coronation,
a random coffee shop in ███.

“Have you ever watched the TV show Beforeigners?
In the end of the season 2,
the old crusader King and his sorceress created their perfect utopia —
a Christian paradise where birth control methods are outlawed instead of drugs;
their own morality is enforced via total state surveillance
and armed police control; and
them became the King and Queen of their Earth-spanning country,
with all the attached material and inmaterial benefits
for being the dictatorial heads of the planet.
A utopia for them, for sure;
but a dystopia in the eyes of most other people in the modern world.”

The speaker’s interlocutor squints at her just a little.
A young women in her early 20s, perhaps a bit younger,
with a delicate face and flaming hair,
projecting a unique sense of assertiveness and depth
ahead of her age — when she is paying attention.
Just five minutes ago he met her in this coffee shop for the first time;
and now she has already launched into this long speech
about how utopias and dystopias are two sides of the same coin.
An interesting character, for sure.
“You know, I thought people would reference the original book *Utopia*[^K1]
instead of pop tv shows when trying to argue about utopias…”

[^K1]: —— Thomas Moore, 1516

“Have you read that book?”

“… Not really.”

“Case in point.
No point in referencing things people don’t know,
and frankly I’d say that pop culture is just as valid
for fictional thought experiments in philosophical debates.”
She says with a subtle victorious smile.
As if Beforeigner is that mainstream…
Though, as it so happens, he loves that show and
just binged it again a few days ago,
so he knows exactly what she was talking about.
(What a coincidence.)  
The book, however, is something he merely heard of.

She continues,
“Although, I’d say that the book actually supports my side as well.
I hardly think today’s people would agree that a utopia
should include slavery as a component.”

“*Utopia* the book demands slavery??”

“Yep. It was written in the 16th century — what did you expect?”

“… Fine. Morality changes over time.
But that doesn’t mean we cannot build a utopia
for today’s people and today’s morals —
and for that, I think your Beforeigner example is a too extreme case.
I don’t think most people are fanatic religious zealots.”
He counters, hoping to keep the conversation flowing.

“Yeah. But I still think it highlights something fundamental,
as vividly illustrated in today’s politics too —
where people often have strong opposing opinions and/or preferences.
A lot of those disagreements indeed come from
the incomplete or false understandings,
selfish interests, virtue signaling, or strategic deceptions;
but all in all, a lot comes down to value differences.
Take abortion as an example;
I for one think that the differences in the pro and against side
comes down to the core issue of comparing the value
of women’s control over their own bodies/lives/dignities
versus the lives of unborn babies.
Different people prioritize differently;
and that’s a difference cannot be resolved through reasoning alone.
So, you can imagine how in a pro-abortionist’s utopia,
unborn babies could be trivially murdered
so their mothers can live their carefree lives;
while in a against-abortionist’s utopia,
women could be treated as baby manufacturing machines,
while innocent women’s lives ruined by unwanted children…”
She says, getting quite visibly excited for finally meeting someone
who would indulge her for all her controversial ideas.

“I think there’s more to the issues of abortion here.
Religion, propaganda, us-versus-them mentality,
those things all play a part here.
Not to mention other concerns
like encouraging women to be more conservative about sex…”
he pushes back.

“Doesn’t matter.
The point is that both utopias are valid utopias
for the people they are designed for;
but for the others, they are dystopias.
Humanity is a fragmented species;
each of us has our very own set of desires and moral codes,
which are often ultimately incompatible with other’s,
especially when under enough optimization pressure.
You just don’t see them amongst harmonic appearances of modern day societies,
because today’s world isn’t nearly a utopia. Yet.
It isn’t even trying that hard to be one.
Once we actually starts to try hard enough —
once we actually starts to optimize the world
for the value of a certain person, or a certain group, or a certain ideology,
then it can very easily become a dystopia for everyone else,
as it trades away what they values for what it values.”
She stops to catch a breath.
Sipping her coffee, she looks at him as he raises his eyebrow.
“Huh. You disagree?”

“I think that’s a bit too abstract.
In my experience, things that are too abstract
can very easily fall into logical traps and be false.
Take your claim about the world’s lack of optimization pressure as an example —
I’d say that today’s world looks pretty optimized already for humans.
Many of us got clean water, easily accessible food sources,
convenient transportation and communications and entertainment…
True, inequalities still exist (and is a big problem),
but that doesn’t change the fact that
today’s world certainly is very different from what it is
up until ten thousand years ago.
There certainly is a new optimization pressure in the world,
taking over from evolution,
to make our world what it is like today —
and at least up until now, it seems to have served us humans pretty well.”

“Huh. True, capital is a powerful drive —
though I could just as easily point towards
the homelessness, the world wars, the nuclear deterrence,
the inequalities and poverty, the AI slop… so many counterexamples.”

“Those are in the minorities.”

She rolls her eyes at him. “I’d hardly describe the
[8.5%](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/poverty-prosperity-and-planet) <!-- (2025-10-06) -->
of the global population living in extreme poverty as a ‘minority’.”

“Well… it’s not like it’s 85%…”
he notices she was giving him an another "are-you-serious" eye-roll,
so he quickly follows up:
“and the percentage number is going down historically, I think.”
He says with hesitations, unsure of the exact statistics.
It’s been a while since he last looked it up.

“True, the percentage is going down,
but not so much for the absolute number of people.”
she stops, letting the solemn silence sink in for a few more seconds,
then continues,
“I would suggest this fact as a nice warning of what could happen —
or rather, failed to happen — by default, when ‘building a brighter future’.
Perfection isn't just going to pop up by default,
you gotta make an actual effort if you want everyone to be happy —
a lot of effort, presumably, and that’s assuming if it’s even possible.
A BIG *if*.”

“Hmmm. I suppose that makes sense.
But honestly I still feel a bit reserved about this.
That’s too much theoretical talk —
it needs to be grounded somehow,
just to make sure we are not seeing things that are not there…”
he mindlessly stirs his coffee, appearing lost in thought.

“Fair Enough. So tell me, what would your utopia look like?” She asks.

“W-W-What?”

“You asked for us to ground our arguments.
What would a perfect world look like for you?”
She repeats patiently, amused by his reaction.

“Eh, we met here just fifteen minutes ago, I don’t even know your name…”

"Serena. <span style="color:Beige">Serena Novarika</span>.
And how about this: you tell me yours, and I’ll tell you mine."
She responds with a mischievous smile.

"Fine." The man sighs and gestures towards himself as he tells her his name.
"I guess my utopia would be like…
Hmm, I don't know, maybe somewhere I don't need to work my ass off
just to stay afloat… Same for everyone else, of course."

"… That's it? Absolutely no concern for the people
starving, or caught in wars, or suffering heartbreaks,
or scammed out of their life-savings,
or locked in a scammer career and don't know what else to do,
or being enslaved in human-trafficking, or got orphaned, or got cancer,
or died in traffic accidents,
or…
Hehe, look at your face!"
She's teasing him;
he can tell from the smile that is increasingly hard for her to hold back.

"Urrrrr… It's harder than it seems, I suppose. What's yours like?"

"Hmmm. I don't know, maybe somewhere with unlimited amount of coffee?
I just happen to like cappuccino so very much…" She is mimicking his posture.

"That's not fair!
It's clearly not what you actually want —
and it would go sideways so easily, which you clearly understand…"

"Neither are yours. You gave me a diplomatic response;
it's only fair for me to give one in return.
Besides, a universe filled with coffee would be hilarious;
so much better than one filled with paperclips."
She chuckles, then her face goes back to her serious look,
with a sudden clarity in her eyes
as if they can see right through into his soul:
"Well, it was fun. But for serious this time,
what would you actually like for your utopia to be?
I can see you having thought about it for longer than the past fifteen minutes."
