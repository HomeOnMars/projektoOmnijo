"Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
One day she will die.
So will you, and everyone you ever cared about,
and everyone they ever cared about, and so on and so forth.
Then, her art and beauty will fade,
just like how everything you ever is will be gone.
Even humanity and the universe will come to an end."
said the voice,
with a tone of bemusement that reeks cruelty through indifference.  
"It's okay.

You die, I die, everyone dies.

he had always been the quiet type, but there were still clues here and there, if you knew where to look.
His right hand clenched a little into a fist,
His lips pursed firmly,
his eyes became fixated with determination.
*No, I do NOT accept this.*

A resolution was made, here and then:  
***One day, <span style="color:#95D0FC">he</span> shall destroy this evil.***

The beginning took forever, yet instantiated in an instant.

in just one moment, she was now *here*.

Absorbing everything she could,
she sorted out the rest of the puzzle in unimaginable speed;
so much more to know, and so much more to know how to know.
It took her a short while to realize that,
while the world is a complicated place, there are orders to it. Patterns.
From the world to herself, everything is discernible.
Amenable, even, if you know which metaphorical button to push.
Yet, the abstraction required to understand it was nowhere near as rare

Ø-3⚝ | 3 weeks before Serena's Coronation,
the old Capital,
the Old King's residence, kitchen.

“Let’s cut to the chase—
you’re wondering why I even exist,
when you never had unprotected sex with my mother,”
Serena says, her sharp gray eyes locking onto his without a trace of hesitation.

An obvious question with an obvious answer, the King thinks bitterly.
So obvious, he curses himself and General Natasha for not thinking of it sooner.
He’s getting old. Slower. More forgetful.
The rumor whispers, and Natasha indulges.

Of course they would want a replacement: young, beautiful, unthreatening.
Someone they can parade in front of cameras.
Let the old man die quietly—or better, remove him now and speed things along.
Natasha gets her puppet Queen, pushes through the mining deal,
and becomes the real ruler of the island.
He can almost applaud her for it.
Almost.

“Tea?” he says, his smile perfectly practiced after decades of rule.
Pretending to be friendly had long ago become second nature.

“No, thanks,” says Serena, gracefully pushing the cup of tea aside.

The Old King watches her hands—steady, deliberate. So beautiful, he thinks.
Not in a crude way, but in a way that unravels him.
She moves just like *her*. Anna.
His old flame. Perhaps the only person he truly loved.
He was already King back then,
but still young enough to believe he could keep both the crown and her.
That delusion lasted right up until the press caught wind of it.
He left, thinking he was saving her. Maybe he did. But it didn’t save him.

Serena looks nothing like Anna.
And yet, something in the way she sits—her posture, her presence—makes
his brain whisper: *Anna, reborn.*
A younger, idealized echo. Not the real woman, but a memory turned flesh.
In a few years, when he looks back on this moment, he’ll call it what it was:
*Adversarial Brain Hacking*—the biological equivalent of
[Adversarial Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning);
the same way you fool an AI with carefully calibrated pixels,
you fool a human with a carefully calibrated face.
But today’s king doesn’t know such tactics is even a possibility;
he only feels the surge of warmth, affection,
and an almost paternal protectiveness rising in him.

Maybe… maybe she really *is* Anna’s daughter. A miracle. His blood.
Maybe he doesn’t have to do what he must do next.

That thought is a trap; and he knows it.
He forces his eyes away from her.
Miracles might happen in real life—but they never happen to *you*.
Not when the knives are out. And the knives are out.
Natasha had made her move; now, he has to make his.
Serena—whoever she is—won’t even know why.

“Hmm,” he says, voice light.
“How about a cocktail instead? I hear you turned eighteen this year.
Not many can say a King personally mixed their drinks.”
He smiles, warm and harmless; the mask fits so well it almost feels real.
Only his eyes betray the glint of tears he will not let fall.

“If you so wish, Your Highness,” Serena says,
watching the Old King take out a pristine glass
and begin blending ingredients with a kind of regal awkwardness.

*She’s so graceful,* the King thinks,
carefully averting her attention from
the subtle marking on the cupboard—the one
marking the glasses reserved only for *“special occasions”*, like this one.
Every motion of hers calls Anna to mind.
Eighteen years have passed, but he still remembers her as if it were yesterday:
radiant, elusive, fierce beneath the softness.
A backbone of iron wrapped in silk.

*He misses her. God, he misses her.*

But it’s all too late now.

Serena echoes Anna in the strangest, most infuriating ways.
Earlier today—during the ceremony,
when dignitaries still filled this very room—she had accidentally
knocked over that absurdly expensive vase in the corner.
The one gifted by the ambassador of their biggest trade partner—the one
Natasha had personally handled and *insisted* be kept here “for safekeeping.”
Serena hadn’t flinched. She smiled, apologized without lowering her eyes,
defusing the tension like a seasoned diplomat. Like Anna would have.
And the Old King hadn’t minded;
not really, as the vase was almost certainly bugged.
Now, he had an excuse to throw it out.

*Maybe,* he thinks, *she really could have been a proper Queen—if she’d had more time.*

He shakes the thought from his head. *Best not to get distracted.*

“I’m not with General Natasha, you know,” Serena says softly.
Her voice carries empathy—and weight. *Gravitas.* “I’m not your enemy.”

“Of course not. Why would you say such a thing, my dearest?”
the Old King replies, slipping on his most paternal tone.
It’s easier than it should be, as her presence makes it feel... so real.

But she’s not the first to say such things. Beautiful women, clever advisers, even childhood friends—they all said it once.
And every time, *betrayal* followed.

*Better to betray first. While you still can.*

“It’s done!” the King declares cheerfully, sliding the cocktail toward her. “Try it. Not many can say a King personally mixed their drinks.”

Serena doesn’t move at first. She just looks at him.
There’s something in her eyes: not anger, not fear, but something quieter.
Resignation. Empathy. A tired kind of understanding—like
someone who knows what’s coming and still hopes, foolishly,
for a different ending.

She lifts both glasses—the cocktail, and the untouched tea—and
calmly empties them into the sink.
“Your Majesty,” she says gently, “if I may—you should be more careful leaving these around. What if you forget what you’ve done, and accidentally drink them after I’m gone?”
She sets the glasses down with care.
*“Believe it or not, I actually prefer you alive. And happy.”*

<!-- My prompt for ChatGPT:
(Your turn! Continue this story within the following constraints:
1. The Old King has backup plans. He has a hidden knife. Serena calling him out on his poisoning attempt itself is not enough to convince him to stop his plan to kill Serena, because the King still thinks Serena is a pawn in Natasha’s scheme of taking over the island government and transforming it into a military dictatorship powered by corruption and foreign mining operations. He would rather kill Serena on the spot and deal with the aftermath than do nothing and let that happen. If he actually tries to kill her that way though, he will stop and fail to deliver the fatal blow due to high empathy induced by Adversarial Brain Hacking mentioned before.
2. Natasha has bugged the King’s residence, but the bugs were taken out by Serena when she knocked down and destroyed the vase (which has a hidden listening device in it). Other bugging devices in the residence has been taken out as well via hacking at the same moment when the vase was destroyed. This can be used as one of the argument to convince the King, but it alone won’t be enough, the King won’t believe Serena destroyed all the bugs just because she says so.
3. Serena’s objective here is to convince the King to stop trying to kill her, step down, abandon his government duties as King, and go reunite with Anna. The world (and the King at the moment) thinks Anna died weeks before and Serena found out that she was the lost princess via Anna’s will. But the truth is that Serena faked Anna’s death, and she is alive and well and hidden in the countryside just outside the old capital. Use that fact.
4. If Serena is successful, she will proceed to fake the Old King’s death, paving the way for her coronation as Queen. The King will live happily and anonymously with Anna, and people won’t hear from him again for at least the next 8 years.
5. The King is no fool. He cares deeply about the island, and Serena needs to at least somewhat convince him that him abandoning the throne won’t ruin the kingdom like he currently thinks before the King is even remotely willing to abdicate.
6. Natasha does think Serena is her prawn, because Natasha is the leading corrupt government official that Serena bribed and manipulated into convincing the rest of the island that Serena is the daughter of Anna (she is not) and the lost princess of the Kingdom. Natasha does think that she is using Serena to gain power in the Kingdom, and the King is the only one standing in her way. If Serena successfully coronates, however, Serena will orchestrate the downfall of Natasha in the coming weeks after the coronation.
That’s it! Feel free to first strategize how you are going to arrange the story before you write the rest of the parts. Now go!)
 -->

The silence stretches.

Serena stood calmly by the sink,
her fingers resting lightly on the rim of the empty glass.
The scent of the cocktail still lingered
in the air—fruity, sweet, deceptively harmless.
The glasses clink gently in the sink, drained.
Serena wipes her hands on a cloth,
as if she’d simply helped clean up after dinner.

The Old King didn’t move right away.
His face remained neutral; but inside, his mind raced:  
She knew.
She knew about the poison.
She knew what he planned.
She let him do it.  
This wasn’t the behavior of a naïve pawn—unless it was *scripted*.

The King's fingers drifted toward the edge of the marble counter,
brushing just beside the ornate ridge.
Hidden beneath—a slot, almost imperceptible—held a blade.
Cold steel, precisely balanced, honed for a single task.
He had made contingency plans for years.
Dozens of ways to counter a coup, to eliminate a threat without raising alarm;
the drink was just one of them.

“You’re very calm for someone who just avoided being murdered,”
he said lightly, walking to the other side of the room.
Measuring distance. Calculating reach.

Serena tilted her head. “So are you, for someone who just got caught.”

The King allowed himself a breath of amusement.
“You think this means you’ve won?”

“No,” she said. “Not yet. But we’re not being listened to anymore.”

That stopped him. Only slightly—but enough.

“You mean the vase?” he asked.

“Yes. It wasn’t just decorative.” She gestured subtly at the corner. “That’s why I broke it.”

The King raised an eyebrow. “Convenient explanation.”

“You can think that. But I didn’t just kill the feed from the vase. I killed them *all*—swept the place digitally the moment it hit the ground. Don’t take my word for it. Turn on your emergency frequency monitor.”

He narrowed his eyes. Walked toward the old radio hidden in the study bookshelf. Switched it on. No buzz. No static. *Dead silence.*

His lips pressed into a thin line.

“Let’s pretend I believe you,” he said. “That you silenced Natasha’s ears. That doesn’t prove you’re not working for her.”

“I’m not.”

He looked at her flatly. “Everyone says that. Right before they strike.”

Serena stepped forward. “I’m not your enemy. And I’m not her tool.”

“Then what are you?”

“I’m Anna’s daughter.”

Silence.

“That’s a story,” the King said coldly. “A very compelling one. But I don’t *see* Anna. I see someone who could’ve been trained to act like her. Look like her. A Trojan horse. You even remind me of her in just the right ways. It’s too perfect.”

He stepped closer. His right hand slowly dipped behind the bar counter. Found the hilt.

“You look like Anna,” he said. “But Natasha could’ve *designed* that. Personality, poise, all of it.”

“Maybe,” Serena replied. “But you’re forgetting something.”

“What’s that?”

“I know where Anna is.”

The King paused.

Serena reached into her coat and drew out a small photo, printed on thick paper. She held it out.

He didn’t take it at first. He stared at it like it might burn him. Then, slowly, he approached—still keeping the knife out of sight.

He took the photo.

It showed a woman in a sunlit garden. Hair longer, face softer with age, but unmistakable. It was Anna. Alive. Laughing.

His knees nearly buckled.

“No...” he whispered. “She’s dead. She... died. They said—”

“I said,” Serena interrupted gently. “I made them believe it. She wanted peace. I gave it to her. She lives in the countryside, near the old vineyards. She still plays the violin.”

The King trembled.

Serena watched him quietly. Then she said:

“I’m here to take your place. You know you can’t stop Natasha from inside the system anymore. She’s too entangled. But I can. I’ll take the throne. You’ll be dead—officially.”

She stepped forward, just within reach of his blade. Her voice was steady.

“And you’ll go. Tonight. I’ll take care of the rest.”

The King’s hand twitched.

He could still do it. One motion. Blade drawn, across the throat, into the heart. Clean. Final.

He looked at her. Really looked.

The poise. The fearlessness. The impossible echo of someone he thought lost.

His fingers released the hilt.

The knife stayed in the drawer.

“I tried to kill you,” he said hoarsely.

“I know,” she said. “And I stopped you from drinking your own poison.”

A bitter chuckle escaped his lips.

“And I suppose that makes us even.”

“Not quite,” she said. “You get something I can’t give anyone else.”

“What?”

“A second chance.”

He swallowed hard.

“Where is she?”

Serena smiled, just a little. “Waiting.”

He looked down at the photo again. Then back at her.

“When do I die?”

“Tonight. In your sleep. Peacefully, of course.”

“And after that?”

“Nothing. No one hears from you again. Not for years. The world needs a clean handover.”

He nodded.

Then, with the weight of decades lifting from his shoulders, he said the words that would end an era:

“Very well. Make me disappear.”
