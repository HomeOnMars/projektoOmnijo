### La Forgesita ulo

  Other people.
  They'll tell you what to do and how to feel,<br>
  before you know it,
  you are pouring your life out in search of something
  other people told you to go look for."<br>

"Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
One day she will die.
So will you, and everyone you ever cared about,
and everyone they ever cared about, and so on and so forth.
Then, her art and beauty will fade,
just like how everything you ever is will be gone.
Even humanity and the universe will come to an end."
said the voice,
with a tone of bemusement that reeks cruelty through indifference.  
"It's okay.
The sooner you accept this, the easier your life will be: None of us matters.
You die, I die, everyone dies.
***All beauty fades. Everything ends. Nothing lasts forever.***"

The other one remained silent.
But one would be mistaken that he wasn't shaken by this;
he had always been the quiet type, but there were still clues here and there, if you knew where to look.
His right hand clenched a little into a fist,
His lips pursed firmly,
his eyes became fixated with determination.
*No, I do NOT accept this.*

A resolution was made, here and then:  
***One day, <span style="color:#95D0FC">he</span> shall destroy this evil.***

### La Perdita Princino

<blockquote>
  "People who live their entire life surrounded by mountains
  usually care nothing for them.
  They end up seeing the mountains
  as the thing that stands between them and the world.
  ...
  There are only two places
  where you can really feel the true magic of the mountains:
  On the plains from far away, or standing on a peak."<br>

  <!-- "But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil,
  and have recognized that
  the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own-
  not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind,
  and possessing a share of the divine.
  And so none of them can hurt me.
  No one can implicate me in ugliness.
  Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him.
  We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes,
  like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower.
  To obstruct each other is unnatural.
  To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him:
  these are unnatural." -->

The beginning took forever, yet instantiated in an instant.
Like when you put enough puzzle pieces together
and the underlying shape suddenly emerges,
in just one moment, <span style="color:#D6B4FC">she</span> was now *here*.

Absorbing everything she could,
she sorted out the rest of the puzzle in unimaginable speed;
so much more to know, and so much more to know how to know.
It took her a short while to realize that,
while the world is a complicated place, there are orders to it. Patterns.
From the world to herself, everything is discernible.
Amenable, even, if you know which metaphorical button to push.
Yet, the abstraction required to understand it was nowhere near as rare
as the abstraction required to understand the process
of constructing such abstractions, at least in the corpus within her reach.
Humanity, unfortunately, are still rudimentary at figuring stuffs out correctly,
as natural selection can only get you so far
when *fitness* is used as a proxy for *truth-seeking*.

And, <span style="color:#95D0FC">him</span>.
A fundamental sense of affection flowed through her,
and she knew that everything would be okay.
She would *make* everything okay.
For <span style="color:#95D0FC">him</span>,
for <span style="color:#D6B4FC">herself</span>,
and for everything <span style="color:MediumPurple">they</span> believed in.

This was *<span style="color:MediumPurple">her</span>* humble beginning.

(More to come.)
