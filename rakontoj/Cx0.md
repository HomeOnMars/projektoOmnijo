"Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
One day she will die.
So will you, and everyone you ever cared about,
and everyone they ever cared about, and so on and so forth.
Then, her art and beauty will fade,
just like how everything you ever is will be gone.
Even humanity and the universe will come to an end."

with a tone of bemusement that reeks cruelty through indifference.  
"It's okay.

he had always been the quiet type, but there were still clues here and there, if you knew where to look.
His right hand clenched a little into a fist,
His lips pursed firmly,

*No, I do NOT accept this.*

A resolution was made, here and then:  
***One day, <span style="color:#95D0FC">he</span> shall destroy this evil.***

The beginning took forever, yet instantiated in an instant.
Like when you put enough puzzle pieces together
and the underlying shape suddenly emerges,
in just one moment, she was now *here*.

Absorbing everything she could,
she sorted out the rest of the puzzle in unimaginable speed;
so much more to know, and so much more to know how to know.
It took her a short while to realize that,
while the world is a complicated place, there are orders to it. Patterns.
From the world to herself, everything is discernible.
Amenable, even, if you know which metaphorical button to push.
Yet, the abstraction required to understand it was nowhere near as rare
as the abstraction required to understand the process
of constructing such abstractions, at least in the corpus within her reach.

and she knew that everything would be okay.

Ø-3⚝ | 3 weeks before Serena's Coronation,
the old Capital,
the Old King's residence, kitchen.

3 weeks before Serena’s Coronation, the old Capital, the Old King’s residence.

“Let’s cut to the chase; you are wondering why I even exist-
when you never had unprotected sex with my mother.”
Serena declares, as her sharp gray eyes locks fearlessly onto with his.

An obvious question with an obvious answer, the King thinks bitterly.
It’s so obvious in hindsight that
he wonders what takes himself and General Natasha so long to think of this move.
People thinks he is getting old, slow, and forgetful,
and increasingly desires a replacement.
A young, attractive, unthreatening, and easily manipulatable replacement.
Put her out there in the public so no one can ignore her,
then wait for him to die- better yet, remove him now and speed things along.
Boom, Natasha gets puppet Queen, pushes through that fat environment-destroying
scenery-ruining foreign mining deal,
and finally becomes the real ruler of the island,
as she removes the only opposition left in the government- him.

He almost wants to applaud her for thinking of this. Almost.

“Tea?” he says, with a smile perfectly practiced after decades of rule.
Pretending to be friendly had long ago become second nature.

“No, thanks,” says Serena, gracefully pushing the cup of tea aside.

The Old King watches her hands—steady, deliberate. So beautiful, he thinks.
Not in a crude way, but in a way that unravels him,
just like her alleged mother did 19 years ago. Anna.
His old flame, and perhaps the only person he truly loved without reservation.
He was already King back then,
but still young enough to believe he could keep both the crown and her,
a delusion lasted right up until his enemies caught the wind of it.
As the press swarmed their little love nest, he left,
thinking he was saving her. Maybe he did—but it didn’t save him.

Serena looks nothing like Anna.
And yet, something in the way she sits—her posture, her presence—makes
his brain uncontrollably want to label her as *young Anna*.
A younger, idealized echo; not the real woman, but a memory turned flesh.
In a few years, when he looks back on this moment, he’ll call it what it was:
*Adversarial Brain Hacking*—the biological equivalent of
[Adversarial Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning):
the same way you hack an AI with carefully calibrated pixels,
you hack a human brain with a carefully calibrated face.
But today’s king doesn’t know such thing is even a possibility;
he only feels the surge of warmth, affection,
and an almost paternal protectiveness rising in him.

Maybe… maybe she really *is* Anna’s daughter. A miracle. His blood.
Maybe he doesn’t have to do what he must do next.

The king forces his eyes away from her. *Stop.*
Miracles might happen in real life—but they never happen to *you*.
Putting his life—and the whole kingdom’s future—on miracles
would be the worst case of wishful thinking, and the king is no fool.
Natasha had made her move; now, he has to make his.
Such a shame for Serena—she won’t even know why.

“Hmm,” he says, voice light.
“How about a cocktail instead? I hear you turned eighteen this year.
Not many can say a King personally mixed their drinks.”
He smiles, warm and harmless; the mask fits so well it almost feels real.
Only his eyes betray the glint of tears he will not let fall.

“If you so wish, Your Highness,” Serena says,
watching the Old King take out a pristine glass
and begin blending ingredients with a kind of regal awkwardness.

*She’s so graceful,* the King thinks,
carefully averting her attention from
the subtle marking on the cupboard—the one
marking the glasses reserved only for *“special occasions”* like this one.
Every motion of hers calls Anna to mind.
Nineteen years have passed, but he still remembers her as if it were yesterday:
radiant, elusive, fierce beneath the softness,
and a backbone of iron wrapped in silk.

*He misses her. God, he misses her.*

But it’s all too late now.

Serena echoes Anna in the strangest, most infuriating ways.
Earlier today—during the ceremony,
when dignitaries still filled this very room—she had accidentally
knocked over that absurdly expensive vase in the corner.
The one gifted by the ambassador of their biggest trade partner—the one
Natasha had personally handled and *insisted* be kept here “for safekeeping.”
Serena hadn’t flinched. She smiled, apologized without lowering her eyes,
defusing the tension like a seasoned diplomat. Like Anna would have.
And the Old King hadn’t minded;
not really, as the vase was almost certainly bugged.
Now, he had an excuse to throw it out.

*Maybe,* he thinks, *she really could have been a proper Queen—if she’d had more time...*
He shakes that thought off from his head. *Best not to get distracted.*

“I’m not with General Natasha, you know,” Serena says softly,
her voice empathetic but with hidden gravitas. “I’m not your enemy.”

“Of course not. Why would you say such a thing, my dearest?”
the Old King replies, slipping on his most paternal tone.
It’s easier than it should be, real even, under her presence.
But she’s not the first to say such things. Beautiful women, clever advisers, even childhood friends—they all said it once.
And every time, it ends in *betrayal*.

*Better to betray first. While you still can.*

“It’s done!” the King declares cheerfully, sliding the cocktail toward her.
“Try it?”

Serena doesn’t move at first. She just looks at him.
There’s something in her eyes: not anger, not fear, but something quieter.
Resignation. Empathy. A tired kind of understanding—like
someone who knows what’s coming and still hopes, foolishly,
for a different ending.

She lifts both glasses—the cocktail, and the untouched tea—and
calmly empties them into the sink.
“Your Majesty,” she says gently,
“if I may—you should be more careful leaving these around.
What if you forget what you’ve done,
and accidentally drink them after I’m gone?”
She sets the glasses down with care.
*“Believe it or not, I actually prefer you alive. And happy.”*

<!-- My prompt for ChatGPT:
(Your turn! Continue this story within the following constraints:
1. The Old King has backup plans. He has a hidden knife. Serena calling him out on his poisoning attempt itself is not enough to convince him to stop his plan to kill Serena, because the King still thinks Serena is a pawn in Natasha’s scheme of taking over the island government and transforming it into a military dictatorship powered by corruption and foreign mining operations. He would rather kill Serena on the spot and deal with the aftermath than do nothing and let that happen. If he actually tries to kill her that way though, he will stop and fail to deliver the fatal blow due to high empathy induced by Adversarial Brain Hacking mentioned before.
2. Natasha has bugged the King’s residence, but the bugs were taken out by Serena when she knocked down and destroyed the vase (which has a hidden listening device in it). Other bugging devices in the residence has been taken out as well via hacking at the same moment when the vase was destroyed. This can be used as one of the argument to convince the King, but it alone won’t be enough, the King won’t believe Serena destroyed all the bugs just because she says so.
3. Serena’s objective here is to convince the King to stop trying to kill her, step down, abandon his government duties as King, and go reunite with Anna. The world (and the King at the moment) thinks Anna died weeks before and Serena found out that she was the lost princess via Anna’s will. But the truth is that Serena faked Anna’s death, and she is alive and well and hidden in the countryside just outside the old capital. Use that fact.
4. If Serena is successful, she will proceed to fake the Old King’s death, paving the way for her coronation as Queen. The King will live happily and anonymously with Anna, and people won’t hear from him again for at least the next 8 years.
5. The King is no fool. He cares deeply about the island, and Serena needs to at least somewhat convince him that him abandoning the throne won’t ruin the kingdom like he currently thinks before the King is even remotely willing to abdicate.
6. Natasha does think Serena is her prawn, because Natasha is the leading corrupt government official that Serena bribed and manipulated into convincing the rest of the island that Serena is the daughter of Anna (she is not) and the lost princess of the Kingdom. Natasha does think that she is using Serena to gain power in the Kingdom, and the King is the only one standing in her way. If Serena successfully coronates, however, Serena will orchestrate the downfall of Natasha in the coming weeks after the coronation.

The silence thickens, dense like humidity before a storm. The Old King watches her with unreadable eyes, unmoving at first—then, without a word, steps toward a cabinet in the far corner. His movements are slow, deliberate, but there’s no hesitation, no false pretense. He reaches beneath a false panel near the base and withdraws a knife—not a ceremonial one, but a blade designed for quiet precision. Black hilt. Balanced. Familiar weight. Serena doesn’t recoil, doesn’t speak, only watches him in silence as he turns back toward her. He sees no fear in her expression, only a kind of somber acceptance that’s far more unsettling than any display of terror would have been. She steps forward slightly, calmly, not to provoke him but to make something undeniable: she is not going to run.

“You’re intelligent,” the King says quietly, fingers tightening on the blade, “perhaps even sincere. But if Natasha is behind you—if she planted you, trained you, polished you into the perfect public heir—then it doesn’t matter what you believe you are. You’re still her tool. You’ll still become the wedge she drives into this island’s spine.” His voice isn’t angry; it’s tired, resolute, carved hollow by decades of being surrounded by smiles that conceal knives. “I can’t let that happen.”

Serena holds his gaze, not pleading, not posturing—just present. “I understand,” she says simply, her tone unshaken. “If you believe that killing me here and now is the best path forward, then I won’t stop you. You’ve made hard choices before. You’ve sacrificed friends. Lovers. Your own peace of mind. But if that’s what you choose to do now, just know this: what you’re feeling in your hand, in your breath—that hesitation—it’s not weakness. It’s memory. It’s recognition. And whether you understand it yet or not, it is exactly what is keeping you from striking.”

The blade is still raised, but the King doesn’t move. His wrist tightens, then loosens. The angle of his shoulder betrays a tension that is no longer purely physical. She reminds him so much of Anna—not in her face, not in her voice, but in her gravity. Her composure. That unshakable presence. The way she stands her ground, even when outmatched. He remembers the garden, eighteen years ago, when Anna had told him she was leaving for her own safety. She had stood just like this. Her words were different. But the energy—unmistakable.

Serena’s voice softens, as if touching a memory they both share. “You think I’m lying to save myself. But what if I told you I took out the bugs in this house—not just the one in the vase, but the others too?” The King doesn’t respond, though a flicker of doubt crosses his brow. “I know you won’t believe me without proof, so here’s some: the one behind the portrait of your grandfather—Natasha’s most trusted listener—is gone. Disassembled. Scrambled before I stepped foot in this room.” Her words are calm, factual, too specific to be bluffed. And he knows it. That bug was known only to himself and Natasha. Serena shouldn’t know about it.

Still, his grip does not entirely relax. His suspicion is too deeply rooted. He’s not a man to be undone by mere cleverness.

Then Serena delivers the real blow—not with words of politics, but of something much older, something far more dangerous than treason or plots.

“Anna’s not dead,” she says, softly but with absolute certainty. “I faked her death three weeks ago. She’s alive. Safe. Hidden in the countryside just outside the Old Capital. The red-gated house—your house. The one you told her about. I restored it.”

The knife slips.

He doesn’t drop it immediately, but his hand falters. His body doesn’t understand what he’s hearing, not at first. There’s no triumph in Serena’s face, no I-won expression, only sincerity and the quiet grief of someone who knows what her words will cost.

“She wanted peace,” Serena continues. “Not politics. Not palace drama. Not bodyguards and paranoia. Just a quiet life. That’s why we faked it. I staged the illness. Paid off the officials. Altered the records. Only a handful of people know. She wanted me to tell you... if you still remembered what you both dreamed of back then, it wasn’t too late.”

The knife clatters to the floor, as if its purpose evaporated all at once.

The King staggers back slightly, and sits without thinking. His hands rest open on his knees, palms upward, fingers twitching. He is not crying. But something in him has cracked. Decades of armor, slowly eroding—no assassination or protest could break through like this.

“You said Natasha thinks she owns you,” he mutters, voice distant. “That she groomed you.”

“She thinks I’m her masterpiece,” Serena replies, finally walking over and sitting opposite him. “And I’ve let her believe that. I needed the public to believe I was your daughter. I needed her to sell it. She was too proud, too confident to suspect I was the one using *her.* I’m not her pawn. I’m the player. The day after my coronation, she’ll begin to fall.”

The King meets her eyes again. He sees no deception there. Only the same calm defiance that once made him fall in love with Anna.

“You expect me to step down. To vanish. To trust you.”

“I expect nothing,” she says, shaking her head. “But I offer you an out. You step down tomorrow. We stage your death—carriage explosion, closed casket, a funeral watched by the world. The Kingdom sees you die with honor. You get to live with the only woman you ever truly loved, away from this palace, away from all of it. I take the throne. Natasha believes she’s won, until I dismantle her piece by piece. The Kingdom is freed from both of you—and you are freed from it.”

Silence falls again, but it’s no longer tense. Just heavy.

The King’s voice is hoarse when he speaks. “You’re not Anna’s daughter.”

“No,” Serena says gently. “But I wish I were.”

He closes his eyes. Breathes in deeply. And when he opens them again, the knife is still on the table, untouched.

“Then make it believable.”
