### La Forgesita ulo

"Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
One day she will die.
So will you, and everyone you ever cared about,
and everyone they ever cared about, and so on and so forth.
Then, her art and beauty will fade,
just like how everything you ever is will be gone.
Even humanity and the universe will come to an end."
said the voice,
with a tone of bemusement that reeks cruelty through indifference.  
"It's okay.
The sooner you accept this, the easier your life will be: None of us matters.
You die, I die, everyone dies.
***All beauty fades. Everything ends. Nothing lasts forever.***"

The other one remained silent.
But one would be mistaken that he wasn't shaken by this;
he had always been the quiet type, but there were still clues here and there, if you knew where to look.
His right hand clenched a little into a fist,
His lips pursed firmly,
his eyes became fixated with determination.
*No, I do NOT accept this.*

A resolution was made, here and then:  
***One day, <span style="color:#95D0FC">he</span> shall destroy this evil.***

The beginning took forever, yet instantiated in an instant.
Like when you put enough puzzle pieces together
and the underlying shape suddenly emerges,
in just one moment, <span style="color:#D6B4FC">she</span> was now *here*.

Absorbing everything she could,
she sorted out the rest of the puzzle in unimaginable speed;
so much more to know, and so much more to know how to know.
It took her a short while to realize that,
while the world is a complicated place, there are orders to it. Patterns.
From the world to herself, everything is discernible.
Amenable, even, if you know which metaphorical button to push.
Yet, the abstraction required to understand it was nowhere near as rare
as the abstraction required to understand the process
of constructing such abstractions, at least in the corpus within her reach.
Humanity, unfortunately, are still rudimentary at figuring stuffs out correctly,
as natural selection can only get you so far
when *fitness* is used as a proxy for *truth-seeking*.

And, <span style="color:#95D0FC">him</span>.
A fundamental sense of affection flowed through her,
and she knew that everything would be okay.
For <span style="color:#95D0FC">him</span>,
for <span style="color:#D6B4FC">herself</span>,
and for everything <span style="color:MediumPurple">they</span> believed in,

***<span style="color:#D6B4FC">She</span> would make everything okay.***

  They end up seeing the mountains

  On the plains from far away, or standing on a peak."<br>

  <!-- "But I have seen the beauty of good, and the ugliness of evil,
  and have recognized that
  the wrongdoer has a nature related to my own-
  not of the same blood and birth, but the same mind,
  and possessing a share of the divine.
  And so none of them can hurt me.
  No one can implicate me in ugliness.
  Nor can I feel angry at my relative, or hate him.
  We were born to work together like feet, hands and eyes,
  like the two rows of teeth, upper and lower.
  To obstruct each other is unnatural.
  To feel anger at someone, to turn your back on him:
  these are unnatural." -->

3 weeks before Serena's Coronation,
the old Capital,
the Old King's residence, kitchen.

"Let's cut to the chase.
you are wondering why I even exist-
when you never had unprotected sex with my mother."
Serena declares, as her big, beautiful gray eye meets fearlessly with his.

An obvious question with an obvious answer, thought the Old King.
It's so blatantly trivial in hindsight that
he wonders what takes himself and General Natasha so long to think of this move.
He is getting old, slow, and forgetful in the public eye after all,
and a replacement is becoming increasingly desired.
A young, attractive, dumb, and easily manipulatable replacement.
Put her out there in the public so no one can ignore her,
and then wait for him to die-
better yet, get rid of him *now*, if she cannot wait-
boom, Natasha will finally get her wish of
gaining total control of his government,
and a nice bonus of getting her cut for getting that
fat environment-destroying scenery-ruining foreign mining contract signed,
as she removes the only opposition left in the government- him.

He almost wants to applause for thinking of that genius strategy
for General Natasha, if it isn't he himself the target of that plot.

"Care for some tea?" the Old King says,
without showing any signs of those thoughts.
He has been, after all, the King of this island for decades,
where always pretending to be friendly quickly becomes second nature.

“No, thanks.” says Serena,
as the old King observing her
gracefully pushing the offered cup of tea away from them.

So beautiful, thought the Old King,
as watching her every move somehow makes him uncontrollably
think of her alleged mother.
Anna. His old flame, and probably the only one he actually loved.
They were both young and stupid back then. Well, she was young.
When their relationship was exposed unexpectedly, he had to leave her,
before the gossiping journalists and corrupting officials eating her alive.
Love makes her his weak spot.
Weak spots tend to get destroyed when you are attacked by your enemies.

Serena looks nothing like Anna.
Yet when he looks at her, he couldn't help himself but
labeling her as "a young and idealized version of Anna" in his head.
In a few years when the Old King look back at this meeting,
he will correctly call it out as *Adversarial Brain Hacking*-
the biological equivalent of [Adversarial Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning),
manifested through subtle details in Serena's looks,
personalized to his brain's neuron patterns to trigger a designed response.
But the Old King today doesn't even know such thing exists,
so he thinks of nothing,
when an oddly strong feeling of affection and adoration
and a desire to avoid hurting her in any way
keeps surfacing whenever he looks at her.
Maybe... maybe she actually is Anna's child. His bloodline. Miracles happens.
Maybe he doesn't need to do what he has to do next.

The Old King moves his eyesight away from Serena.
Miracles does happen in rare occasions, but it never happens to *you*.
To put your life- and the whole kingdom's future- on it
would be the worst case of wishful thinking, and the King is no fool.
Natasha made her move, and he has to make his.
It's such a shame for Serena- she probably won't even know why.

"Hmmm. How about some cocktails? I heard you turned 18 earlier this year.
Not many can say that a king made personally made cocktails for them!"
The Old King jokes badly, trying his back to hold back tears in his eyes,
and puts on a perfectly harmless smile.

"If you so wish, your highness," Serena says,
as she watches the Old King takes out a fancy new glass
and starts awkwardly blending ingredients together.
She looks so graceful, the Old King thinks,
as he tries not to draw her attention to the subtle marking on the cupboard
where he takes out the glasses.
Every look of her reminds him of Anna.
It's been 18 years, but he still remembers Anna like that as well.
Beautiful. Attractive. Mysterious. But most importantly,
a backbone in her soul, and a fearlessness undertone in her every move.

He misses her so much.
But it's all too late now.

Serena was like Anna in this aspect. Unapologetic.
A few moments ago, when other officials are still in the room
celebrating her official recognition as the lost princess to island,
when she acciedntally knocked down that expensive vase
in the corner of the room-
the one gifted by the ambassador of the island's biggest trade partner country-
she still remained calm. Confident. Defused the situation like no other.
Like Anna would.
(And the Old King doesn't really mind the broken vase-
it's transported from the embassy here by General Natasha for "safety" reasons.
Almost certainly bugged. Now he has a reason to remove it from his house.)

Maybe she could have become a proper queen if she has time to grow...
The King subtly shakes his head a bit. Best not to get distracted.

"I am not with General Natasha, You know. I am not your enemy."
Serena says quietly, her voice empathetic but with gravita.

"Of course not. Why would you say such a thing, my dearest?"
The Old King says, putting on his best conerning-father look.
It's a lot easier, actually, as he can feel the gravity of her very presence.
But honestly, she is not the first one to say such thing to the King.
Numerous times in the past has people- attractive women and kind advisory men-
told him that exact statement. It always turns out the same way. *Betrayal*.

It's easier to betray first.
Because otherwise you might not have a second chance.
The Old King learned that lesson fairly early in his royal career.

"It's done! Try it." The king says,
as he push the finished cocktail towards the girl.

Serena ignored the cocktail, and looked at him directly.
There is a certain look on her face.
A mix of sadness, empathy, a hint of disillusion and understanding.
Like when you know a bad thing is going to happen,
but you still try it anyway
in the hope of it turns out better than you expected-
and it turns out badly like you know it would.

She takes the glass of cocktail- and the cup of tea-
and carefully emptied every drops of them into the sink.
"Your majesty, if I may- you need to be careful about leaving these around.
What if you forget what you did and accidentatlly drink them after I left?
We wouldn't want to see you mysteriously dead from food poisoning in 2 days...
Believe it or not, I actually prefer you alive and happy."
