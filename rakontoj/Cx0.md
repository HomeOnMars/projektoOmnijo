"Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
One day she will die.
So will you, and everyone you ever cared about,
and everyone they ever cared about, and so on and so forth.
Then, her art and beauty will fade,
just like how everything you ever is will be gone.
Even humanity and the universe will come to an end."
said the voice,
with a tone of bemusement that reeks cruelty through indifference.  
"It's okay.
The sooner you accept this, the easier your life will be: None of us matters.
You die, I die, everyone dies.
***All beauty fades. Everything ends. Nothing lasts forever.***"

The other one remained silent.
But one would be mistaken that he wasn't shaken by this;
he had always been the quiet type, but there were still clues here and there, if you knew where to look.
His right hand clenched a little into a fist,
His lips pursed firmly,
his eyes became fixated with determination.
*No, I do NOT accept this.*

A resolution was made, here and then:  
***One day, <span style="color:#95D0FC">he</span> shall destroy this evil.***
