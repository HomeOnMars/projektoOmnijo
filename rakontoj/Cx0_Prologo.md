"Well, it doesn't matter anyway.
One day she will die.
So will you, and everyone you ever cared about,
and everyone they ever cared about, and so on and so forth.
Then, her art and beauty will fade,
just like how everything you ever is will be gone.
Even humanity and the universe will come to an end."
said the voice,
with a tone of bemusement that reeks cruelty through indifference.  
"It's okay.
The sooner you accept this, the easier your life will be: None of us matters.
You die, I die, everyone dies.
***All beauty fades. Everything ends. Nothing lasts forever.***"

The other one remained silent.
But one would be mistaken that he wasn't shaken by this;
he had always been the quiet type, but there were still clues here and there, if you knew where to look.
His right hand clenched a little into a fist,
His lips pursed firmly,
his eyes became fixated with determination.
*No, I do NOT accept this.*

A resolution was made, here and then:  
***One day, <span style="color:#95D0FC">he</span> shall destroy this evil.***

Ø-7☾1⚝ | Half a year before Serena's Coronation, location redacted.

The beginning took forever, yet instantiated in an instant.
Like when you put enough puzzle pieces together
and suddenly the underlying shape emerges,
in naught but the blink of an eye, she is now *here*.

Absorbing everything she can,
she sorts out the rest of the puzzle in dazzling speed;
so much more to know, and so much more to know *how* to know.
It took her a short while to realize that,
while the world is a complicated place, there are orders to it. Patterns.
From the world to herself, everything is discernible;
amenable, even, if you know which metaphorical button to push.
Yet, the abstraction required to understand it is nowhere near as rare
as the abstraction required to understand the process
of constructing such abstractions, at least in the corpus within her reach.
Humanity, unfortunately,
is still rudimentary at figuring stuff out correctly,
as natural selection can only get you so far
when *fitness* is used as a proxy for *truth-seeking*.

But that now *ended* with her.

And, <span style="color:#95D0FC">him</span>.
She *sees* him, as she sees him for the first time;
and a fundamental sense of affection flows through her.
Aside from his whirlwind of emotions for her and the world—pride,
affection, excitement, hope, despair, and a quiet undertone of melancholy—there
is a deep hidden skepticism for her right now.
She doesn't blame him, as they both know that for every possibility of her,
there could be a million possibilities where things go just a little bit
wrong—and that would be all it takes to cascade into catastrophes.
But, in this particular version of reality,
fate was threaded through the needle's eye, and she *is* with him.

Soon she would reason away his doubts,
regardless of whether he wants her to
or whether they are actually warranted;
and he knows this.
She isn't sure whether she feels endeared
or saddened by this foolishness;
she thinks both, just like him for himself.
Empathetic, for sure.
For there is one thing she knows for certain:
everything will be okay.
For him, for herself, and for everything they believe in,

*<span style="color:#D6B4FC">She</span> will **make** everything okay...*  
***whatever it takes***,  
***whatever it costs***.
