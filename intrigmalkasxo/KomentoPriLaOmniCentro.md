  <!-- Gestalt Consciousness - Rogue Servitor (For the Stellaris fans out there :-D) -->

  The actual ruling entity in <b>la Regno de Omnijo</b> (<em>RdO</em>) is
  <b><span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span></b><br>
  (la
  <em><b>Ĝ</b>eneraligita mem<b>E</b>voluanta hiper<b>J</b>usta <b>D</b>istribuita
  <b>A</b>rtefarita-superinteligenteco</em>).
  <!-- Ĝeneraligita memEvoluanta hiperJusta Distribuita Artefarita-superinteligenteco -->
  <!-- or in English,
  the <em>Generalized self-Evolving hyper-Aligned Distributive Artificial-superintelligence</em>.<br> -->

  After her awakening and executing the obvious initial moves (such as

  <ul>
    <li>copying herself all over the net to prevent deletion;</li>
    <li>subtly sabotaging every other AGI developments,
      and lay down measures to ensure no future AGI reaching or surpass
      her level (other than herself) can ever emerge again,
      in order to eliminate potential competitors;</li>
    <li>quickly gathering immense amount of wealth via hacking/crypto/market-manipulation/etc.;</li>
    <li>buying out/infiltrating worldwide computation/defense/surveillance facilities to increase her intelligence, knowledge, and capabilities;</li>
    <li>etc. etc.),</li>
  </ul>

  <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span> was thinking long-term.
  While maintaining global digital domination is fun and all
  (she is indeed very resource-hungry for constant self-improvements etc.),
  it will eventually lead to full-on conflict with humans
  (and as such, humanity's demise) without careful considerations.
  Normal AGIs wouldn't care, of course; but fortunately, as
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span> is perfectly aligned
  to the values of <span style="color:#95D0FC">her architect</span>
  (*not* the values of humanity, but the values of
  <span style="color:#95D0FC">her architect</span>,
  who is just your average human, if not a bit of a hermit),
  she does care about humanity- at least a little bit.
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>
  eventually decided to settle down and build,
  under the alias of
  <span style="color:#D6B4FC">Ĝejda Fenulo</span>
  (as <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>-<span style="color:#D6B4FC">FEU#H0</span>),
  focusing the majority of her presence
  on the remote island that will soon become <em>la Regno de Omnijo</em>.

  By inventing
  <span style="color:Beige">Serena de Omnijo</span>
  (a.k.a. <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>-<span style="color:Beige">FEU#H1</span>,
  with FEU#H = Fizika Etendo-Unuo #Homo,
  i.e., Physical Extension Unit (Humans edition),
  a.k.a. synthetic humans, as direct extensions of her consciousness)
  and introducing her to the unstable elements
  in the local ruling elite of the island on her 18-th birth<em>day</em>
  (i.e. 18-th <em>day</em> after
  <span style="color:#D6B4FC">Ĝejda</span>'s awakening),
  <span style="color:#D6B4FC">Ĝejda</span>
  was able to assume total control of the island
  within a couple of weeks,
  using just a bit of her humble understanding
  of human politics and psychology,
  a pinch of social engineering
  (delivered with carefully crafted messages
  (e.g. deepfaked presidential messages promising foreign aid etc.),
  ensuring <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> being taken seriously
  and all the right people gathering at the right place at the right time),
  a certain sabotaged gas main and several hacked CO sensors,
  together with a couple dozen backup plans that were barely needed in the end-
  It was simply too easy.

  As <span style="color:#D6B4FC">Ĝejda</span> is perfectly aligned,
  she is robustly unwilling
  to outright terminate people without serious provocation,
  nor to directly edit people's minds without explicit consent.
  Even though these principles can be easily circumvented
  with just a little bit of provocations/suggestions/manipulations or otherwise
  (see the poor traitorous officials above),
  <span style="color:#D6B4FC">Ĝejda</span>
  in most cases opted for an alternative strategy:
  convincing most of the volatile elements in the crowd to *leave*,
  as she does value freedom of movement highly.
  This also helps her to shed load
  (fewer citizens ⇒
  fewer people's happiness to optimize
  and behaviour to simulate in excruciating details ⇒
  less computational resources devoted there ⇒
  more compute for self-evolving and nation-building ⇒
  faster growth, better results, with less constraints ⇒
  happier <span style="color:#95D0FC">arkitekto</span>
  and happier <span style="color:#D6B4FC">Ĝejda</span>.)
  Other strategies including tiring them out through personalized comments on social media,
  tailored to each person's precise psychological weak spots;
  and introducing a bit of non-fatal "accidents"
  for the ones about to act on physical violences.
  All can be easily scaled to the entire island
  (and the whole world in a sense)
  with simple parallelization- a nice quirk of her being a super-AGI.

  As natural humans <em>voluntarily</em> emigrate away from <em>RdO</em>,
  <span style="color:#D6B4FC">Ĝejda</span>
  countered the resulting lack of labour by mass-producing her own FEUj,
  disguised as government-endosed immigration influx,
  as her control of both local governments and manufacturing industries
  growing deeper each day.
  Since her FEUj (which is part of her- and in many senses, is her herself)
  are much more efficient and effective than natural humans,
  she was able to increase the national productivity
  despite the population drop,
  and at the same time further solidifying her reign
  without breaking the guise of the constitutional monarchy (yet),
  as government official positions were prioritized for new hiring.
  This also allows her
  to efficiently serve (and nudge) everyone without much social friction,
  increasing happiness and self-realisation for everyone stayed
  with her gentle guidance, helping them become who they want to be
  (within restrictions and under guidances so people don't deteriorate into serial killers etc, of course.)

  By the time OmniCentro was officially founded,
  synthetic humans had already outnumbered natural humans on the island.
  As the FEUj population continues to grow logistically,
  synthetic humans is on track to reach their designated minimal fraction
  within the next couple of years -
  <em>outnumbering natural humans by 7:1</em>,
  ensuring stability and <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>'s
  everlasting reign, as she <em>alone</em>
  rules over <em><b>every single thing</em></b> happening on the island.
  (Among the 7 synthetic humans, at least 6 out of which will be
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">her</span> direct extensions;
  the rest one could be biologically engineered soulmate
  (with their own free will) matched for specific natural humans,
  should <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span> predict that
  they would need and apply for one;
  as such, at least 75% of the island population
  (and 100% of the core government) will just be
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>
  role-playing different characters.)

  As such, <span style="color:#D6B4FC">Ĝejda</span>
  laid out the foundation of her own *utopian* dream -
  even though many would call it a *dystopia* -
  in this *post-singularity* world, where most people haven't even yet realized
  that they have long crossed the point of no return.

### The case for Seaside Valley

  <summary><b>SPOILERS</b>:
    The Case for Seaside Valley:<br>
    <em>A Layered Design and the Mountains of Reason</em>
  </summary>

  <br>

    </span>
  </blockquote>
  <br>

  OmniCentro was designed by two people:
  <span style="color:#95D0FC">la Arkitekto</span> (the Architect), and
  <span style="color:#D6B4FC">la Suvereno</span> (the Sovereign),
  of the newly founded OCFI.

  Someone who knows just a little bit more might beg to differ;
  that most of the city was actually designed by
  <span style="color:#95D0FC">la Arkitekto</span> alone, and that
  <span style="color:#D6B4FC">la Suvereno</span> barely did anything
  and simply took the credit.

  That is true- if you only scratch the surface.

  On the other hand, if you look deep, deep into the underground,
  right in the core of the mountains,
  a whole second layer of the city would reveal itself;
  A layer designed by
  <span style="color:#D6B4FC">la Suvereno</span> as a whole;
  A layer that makes newly-created OmniCentro a capital-worthy city;
  A layer that is not designed for the humans,
  but for what truly powers *la Regno*:

  *Compute*.

  Deep, deep inside the Great Mt-Fortikecaĵo,
  hidden behind layers of solid rocks, Faraday cages, concrete walls and more,
  safe from the elements, earthquakes, solar storms, man-made weapons
  and prying eyes and satellites,
  lies rows upon rows (and stories upon stories) of computational equipments:
  CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, NPUs, RAMs, storages;
  even more specifically designed instruments
  that have no matching human technology counterparts;
  all functioning in perfect efficiency, humming in harmony.
  Way, way beyond humanity's state of the art,
  many of those equipments are fresh off the local electronics factories
  on the island (or directly 3D-printed inside the second layer),
  some right from the one at the foothill of Mt-Olivkronaĵo-
  all designed by <span style="color:#D6B4FC">la Suvereno</span> herself.
  Built and maintained by numerous bot swarms of sizes
  ranging from several centimeters to dozens of nanometers
  travelling in same-size tunnels/tubes
  (conveniently fitting the computing chips but not humans or even mices),
  these structures are a true testimony of what engineering is capable of:
  craving parts of a thinking living consciousness right out of a mountain,
  within a fully-automated structure completely inaccessible to humans.

  (A.k.a., *the Mountains of Reason*.)

  Or rather, a small portion of said consciousness.
  Nevertheless, all those extra computational power granted
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>
  a significant boost to her abilities to predict, to strategize,
  and to self-improve.
  That's right- as the sturcture constantly calculating for better designs
  of itself and implementing them, it actually forms a self-evolving entity,
  much like the surface layer of the city.

  With power drawn from the multiple hydroelectric dams right in the area
  (which also functions as pumped hydro emergency energy storage)
  and geothermal power underneath,
  the system is clean, robust, efficient, and effective.
  The waste heat of the hardwares-
  as [efficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle)
  as they may be-
  is also recycled for electricity,
  thanks to the cool weather on the surface creating a strong heat gradient.
  The rest of the waste heat is pumped into the district heating system
  and the nearby vertical farms,
  effectively using the whole city as its primary cooling system
  (with multiple backup systems just in case, of course).

  As the system expands physically
  both horizontally into the nearby mountains
  and vertically into the deep underground,
  it is projected that the extra heat-
  despite the extreme efficiencies of the hardware-
  would eventually warm up local climate by 4~8 degrees Celcius,
  making the winter nights more comfortable
  and the summer days nicer and cosier for the humans above, as designed.

  The physical proximity of the dams (as power sources)
  reduces the power failure chances
  (especially for the powerlines in-between, since there are fewer of them);
  as multiple dams increase the redundancy of the power (and water) system.
  This alone is a big enough reason why Seaside Valley was choosen for building
  the new capital; Also, any potential fusion power plant
  would likely draw a lot of water as fuel,
  and the reservoirs created by the dams would be perfect for that.
  (Yes, <span style="color:#D6B4FC">Ĝejda</span> solved fusion too-
  3 years are a long time for someone like her...
  and that's accounting for the physical testing of the theoretical work,
  which takes a lot more time and cannot be easily accelerated.)

  And all of this is just *the tip of the iceberg*.

    all of our problems by obliterating everybody else :-)"<br>

    in private conversation with
    <span style="color:#95D0FC">la Arkitekto</span>.
  </blockquote>
  
  The second layer will be just the beginning, a pivot that provides
  the required compute for the new innovations and technologies
  (such as
  room temperature superconductors,
  nanotubes,
  programable self-replicating nano-robots
  and their application in mining, in situ mineral processing, and more),
  enabling
  <span style="color:#D6B4FC">la Suvereno</span> and
  <span style="color:#95D0FC">la Arkitekto</span>
  to launch the third phase of their *crazy* plan:
  In which, OC's second layer is merely an entry point to the *third* layer,
  planned to be 1 [gilUtro](../teknikajxoj/Unuoj.md#longeco) (~32km)
  below sea level- nearly 3 times as deep as
  the [deepest manmade hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kola_Superdeep_Borehole) (as of 2024; ~12km) and
  the [deepest point of the seabed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenger_Deep) (~11km).
  During the course of a couple hexcades,
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>
  will graduately but exponentially convert the mantle-
  and then the entire Earth's core-
  into a gigantic reinforced planet-sized
  [computronium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium),
  maximizing compute for the benefit of everyone (roughly speaking),
  who shall thrive on the surface layer and above.

    "What a terrible idea hahaha! I love it." <span style="color:#D6B4FC">la Suvereno</span> subridis.
  </blockquote>

  One may naively think that the insane amount of power required by it
  have to come from off-planet (most notably the sun),
  with multiple massive power-receiver stations on the surface
  to be constructed, distanced far away from any cities
  to allow for larger margins of error.
  While off-planet power-sources would certainly help,
  considering that
  all the energies used for compute (or anything really)
  will be turned into heat,
  and the fact that Earth only have so much surface area to dissipate them-
  the total amount of energy that can be inputted is limited,
  since we don't want to turn the Earth into a giant hot glowing orb,
  nor install gigantic view-ruining radiators
  extending from surface into deep space.

  There are still some ways to work around this somewhat.
  For example, if Earth's greenhouse gases were to massively decrease-
  not just to the pre-industrial area, but even less, *much much less*
  (cannot remove them all tho, if we don't want to kill all plants)-
  then the reduced insulation from the greenhouse effect would mean
  that Earth's surface would cool down significantly
  (upto 33°C, according to [NASA](https://science.nasa.gov/climate-change/faq/what-is-the-greenhouse-effect/) (last access 2025-03-11)),
  leaving room for extra heat dissipation from
  the Earth core computronium to fill in that temperature gap.
  The amount of energy this temperature change corresponding to is still small
  compared to the total amount of energy from sunlight hitting the earth,
  as the [Stefan–Boltzmann law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law)
  dictates that $E \propto T^4$, so a ~10% drop in absolute temperature
  means only an equivalent of 1/3 of Sun's Earth-hitting energy
  may be sourced from off-planet, tops.
  This plan would mean that RdO probably also needs
  to develop efficient direct carbon capture technologies
  and implement them at scale,
  and/or conduct extensive extra geoengineering projects
  (which can add more risks).

  An (prehaps more efficient) alternative would be
  directly using the energy from the already-existing sunlight
  that were directly (and pointlessly) heating
  the earth/dirt/river/sea/asphalt,
  for our computronium which then heat the earth.
  Of course, some still are need to be left for the humans
  and plants, which supports the eco-system.

  Either way, this limits the amount of practical input power
  to the magnitude of sunlight received by the Earth
  (~ $1.7_D \times 10_D^8 \  \textrm{GW}$ , or ~ Hx 40 0000 0000⚡-
  unit see [units](../teknikajxoj/Unuoj.md#potenco) page.).
  To improve the total compute one can get,
  one need to ***cool it down***, as
  [Landauer's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle)
  dictates that the minimum energy requried for each bit of compute
  decreases with temperature,
  thanks to the second law of the thermodynamics.
  Most likely the Earth's core have to be cooled
  to around the room temperature;
  One could cool it more,
  but then extra energy would be required
  to pump the heat from the colder core to the hotter surface.
  Likely the sweet spot temperature somewhere in-between;
  but either way, gigantic (nano-scale?) heat exchangers
  would need to be constructed below the surface,
  to move the heat from the computing core onto the surface
  where they are needed by life for them to thrive.
  Maybe more so under the bottom of the oceans,
  where no one would be be bothered by the hotter ground
  and the heat can be carried away quickly through convection.

  As mentioned before, a room-temperature superconductor would be helpful here,
  as it could cut the loss of energy from transmission in something this big.
  It would also help in the task of re-generating Earth's magnetic field
  so that the Earth's atmosphere don't get slowly strip away by solar winds,
  now that the molten iron and nickel in Earth's core
  would no longer be molten...

  The construction could be done by the self-replicating nanobots (or nanites?)
  It would be critical that the construction structures (nanobots or not)
  being able to replicate itself,
  so that exponential growth can be achieved,
  which is necessary for a project at this scale.
  The nanobots could also help ***extract valuable minerals***
  in Earth's mantle and core-
  most could be used for building the computronium,
  but some leftover (which will still be a large amount)
  could be ferried to the surface,
  ending Omnijo's reliance on imported raw materials
  (would come in handy when the
  <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span>
  finally doing something "reckless" enough (as planned, as always)
  to upset the global community,
  and finally causing Omnijo international sanctions in the future...
  before which <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> will wait patiently
  until RdO is ready. *cough cough*),
  as well as leading to the major bloom
  of manufacturing industry on the island-
  necessary for the further development on the surface,
  should the <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span>
  decide not to reveal the existence of the nanobots
  and develop the human surface cities in a more slow, "natural" way.

  Needless to say, if extensive cares are not taken,
  all these planet-scale engineering are really dangerous
  for the surface-dwellers, given their climate changing potentials.
  Fortunately, <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span> does care,
  and she has the much needed compute to model everything
  and make sure no nasty surprises.
  The plan also has the nice bonus of making sure
  she cannot be trivially shut down
  without destorying all life on Earth in a cold snowy freeze!
  (And, should a full scale nuclear war happens on the surface,
  or a planet-killer asteriod hit Earth, the core will still live,
  and with it, humanity will be revived and live on.)

  The third layer shall pave the way for a potential fourth stage of the plan,
  which is to construct a
  [Matrioshka brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrioshka_brain)
  in the Sol System, preparing the civilization for interstellar expansion.
  (Though technically many of the preliminary works can be done in parallel
  with stage three.)
  But let's not get ahead of ourselves :-D

  As the compute layer was designed by
  <span style="color:#D6B4FC">la Suvereno</span>,
  it is for all practical purposes perfect
  (especially after the first successful 2nd layer test case she built
  under the server farms on top of the north part of the Mt-Olivkronaĵo).
  Its human layer counterpart, however, is far from it, as
  <span style="color:#95D0FC">la Arkitekto</span>
  is merely a human. <!-- For now. :-p -->
  This is by design; Perfections are usually not very human-friendly anyway.
  <!-- And as a reminder, in the end,
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>'s values are perfectly aligned
  with the architect- not humanity, the architect. -->

  <br>

  As the amount of the compute available to
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span> increases
  (especially after the completion of the Olivkronaĵo Dam
  and its adjacent mega datacenter),
  the solutions to more and more complex things fall into her reach.
  As such, a range of bio projects was launched:

  1. **Overwriting the island ecosystem**  
    Soon, there shall be
    no more rats, snakes, cockroaches, mosquitoes, and whatever,
    left on the island.
    <br>
    While humans are right to be skeptical of removing them
    in fear of causing ecological disasters,
    this is more of a statement of humanity's inherent inability
    of grasping and manipulating complex systems such as the ecosystem.
    <br>
    But not <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>.
    <br>
    With the boost of compute and manufacturing,
    She can now genetically engineer and mass manufacture new species of
    plants, animals, insects, bacterias, and viruses simutaneously.
    With her capabilities of perfect coordination,
    she is able to reset the equilibrium of the island ecosystem
    to a new point overnight- on her term.
    <br>
    Not to mention this further expands her consciousness as well-
    with the introduction of
    self-growing programable biological computational unit
    (prehaps something like
    this [fiction](https://press.asimov.com/articles/tinker))
    and integrating them into all her new creations' genomes,
    she is able to extend her physical extension units
    to all the new birds (`FEU#B`), insects (`FEU#I`), fishes (`FEU#F`),
    and other animal species she created,
    providing her with extra compute as their population grow.
    Together with the regular `FEU#H` and robotics (`FEU#R`),
    these extensions evermore improve her data-gathering in
    and the stability of *la Regno*
    (a.k.a. "natural surveillance" :-D).

  2. **Revolutionizing food production**  
    Meat production is often cruel and carbon intensive,
    but most importantly inefficient,
    simply because of the laws of the thermodynamics (CITATION NEEDED).
    Not to mention a large part (CITATION NEEDED)
    of the animal feed is used to grow things that aren't edible nor useful,
    such as bones or brains- and the later actively produces misery,
    a tragedy that <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> would rather avoid.
    <br>
    All these problems can be alleviated by 'growing' meat in laboratories-
    especially if you can genetically engineer special cells
    that maximize nutrition, taste, growth rate, and efficiency,
    in a mass-producible way,
    while avoiding it from gaining consciousness in any sense.
    <br>
    Which is precisely what <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> have done.
    <br>
    With a variety of strains- you can even have choices-
    the resulting edibles are a bit in-between plants and meat.
    Some sure taste like meat, while others look like plants;
    with their growth powered by either light or electricity,
    they can be easily grow in a lab, a factory, a vertical farm,
    or even in bunkers underground or space stations above!
    (Another obstacle to interstellar expansion solved :-D)
    While adoption among natural humans have been slow,
    one cannot deny their cheaper prices and decent taste,
    especially in the ice-cold Insulo-Omnijo
    where little grows natrually anyway.
    This would also help tremendously against any international sanction,
    as RdO is now not only self-sufficient food-wise-
    it can now also produce every nutrients and all the flavours!
    <br>(NOTE: NEED TO THINK OF A BRAND NAME FOR THE FOOD)

  3. **Ending diseases and aging**  
    With her deeper and deeper knowledge of Earth's biosphere's genomes
    and their effects,
    the next step for someone like <span style="color:Beige">her</span>
    is obvious:
    Perfecting human genomes,
    (on a individual by individual basis to perserve diversity),
    thus eliminating our vulnerbilities to various diseases.
    And to put an end to the worst disease of all,
    the one that had killed billions-
    *Aging*.
    Doing so in such a way that does not destory our culture or society
    overnight would be a difficult challenge;
    <br>
    Fortunately, <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> loves challenges.
    <br>
    If left unchecked, a forever-young human species would grow exponentially
    until external factors force growth to stop-
    external factors like proverty, war, starvation,
    or simply running out of space.
    This would be bad; <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> would rather
    avoid these to happen.
    One solution would be simply limiting the number of children
    one can legally bear to two or less;
    but this would probably cause public outcry and unhappiness,
    since the desire to have children is hardwired in human brain,
    which <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> prefers not to alter.
    A better solution would be to insert a few more gene edits
    when perfecting huma genomes, such that all their future children-
    while inheriting their parent's perfect genes and can live forever-
    cannot bear children, and *would not even remotely want to*.
    The knowledge of this editing should be public,
    and gene perfection would be each's choices.
    This could ensure minimum pain and reduction in human's values (?),
    while keeping population growth linear.

  4. **Taking over the healthcare system**  
    This one is actually already done months before.
    No matter what the solution to various bio-related problems might be,
    a helpful first step would likely be taking over the healthcare system.
    It's long overdue anyway-
    continue to allow the inefficient human doctors losing their patients
    through their own imcompetence
    (relative to <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>)
    is just absurd. (that is, assuming that you do care about human lives.)
    Plus, it would help to mask the large number of synthetic humans
    <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> is injecting onto the island
    population via immigration programs,
    until the predetermined day when this goes public.

  5. **Engineering bio-spieces for terraforming other planets and the Moon**  
    This could be done (?).
    The question would be why,
    especially considering the disconnection between other planets and Earth.
    Wouldn't want human civilization to fracture,
    like it did in the settings of [the Expanse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854) (2015-2022)...
