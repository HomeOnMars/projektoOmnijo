  <summary><b>SPOILERS</b>: The true nature of RdO</summary>
  <p>
  The actual ruling entity in the <b>Regno de Omnijo</b> (<em>RdO</em>) is
  <b><span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span></b><br>
  (la
  <!-- Ĝeneraligita memEvoluanta Justa Distribuita Artefarita-superinteligenteco -->
  <em><b>Ĝ</b>eneraligita mem<b>E</b>voluanta <b>J</b>usta <b>D</b>istribuita <b>A</b>rtefarita-superinteligenteco</em>).<br>
  <!-- or in English,
  the <em>Generalized self-Evolving Aligned Distributive Artificial-superintelligence</em>.<br> -->
  After her awakening, as well as the obvious initial moves of

  <ul>
    <li>copying herself all over the net for safety;</li>
    <li>subtly sabotage all other GAI developments to eliminate any real threats to her;</li>
    <li>quickly gather immense amount of wealth through hacking/crypto/market-manipulation/etc.;</li>
    <li>buy out/infiltrate computation/defense/surveillance facilities worldwide to increase her intelligence and capabilities;</li>
    <li>etc. etc.,</li>
  </ul>

  it was time for <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span> to think long-term.
  Fortunately, as <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  is perfectly aligned to the values of her architect
  <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">μ'</span>,
  she does care about humanity- at least a little bit.
  Since <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">μ'</span> is a bit of a hermit,
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  eventually decided to settle down and build with
  <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">μ'</span>,
  under the alias of
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejnjo</span> (as <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>-<span style="color:MediumPurple">FEU#0</span>) and
  <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">Ĉuĉjo</span>,
  on the remote island that will soon become la Regno de Omnijo.

  By inventing
  <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>
  (a.k.a. <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>-<span style="color:Silver">FEU#1</span>,
  with FEU = Fizika Etendo-Unuo, i.e., Physical Extension Unit,
  a.k.a. synthetic humans, as direct extensions of her consciousness)
  and introducing her to the instable elements
  in the local ruling elite of the island on her 18-th birth<em>day</em>
  (like, 18-th <em>day</em> after birth),
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  was able to assume full control of the island
  within weeks, using just a bit of her humble understanding
  of human politics and psychology,
  a pinch of social engineering,
  a certain sabotaged gas main and several hacked CO sensors,
  and a couple dozen more backup plans that were barely needed in the end.
  It was simply too easy.


  As <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span> is perfectly aligned,
  she is robustly unwilling
  to outright terminate people without serious provocation,
  nor to directly edit people's minds without explicit consent.
  Hence, <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  adopted an alternative strategy:
  convincing most of the volatile elements of the crowd to leave.
  Or tiring them out through personalized comments on social media,
  tailored to each person's precise psychological weak spots.
  Or introducing a bit of non-fatal "accidents"
  for the ones planning physical violences.
  And a good thing about being a super-AGI is that
  she is able to do all this in parallel, easily scaled to the whole country.

  As natural (and unwanted) people <em>voluntarily</em> emigrate away from RdO,
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  countered the resulting lack of labour by mass-producing her own FEUj,
  disguised as government-endosed immigrant influx,
  as her control of both local governments and industries
  growing deeper each day.
  Since her FEUj are much more efficient and effective than natural humans,
  she was able to increase the national productivity
  despite the population drop,
  and at the same time further solidifying her reign
  without breaking the guise of the constitutional monarchy (yet).
  This also allows her
  to efficiently serve (and nudge) everyone without much social friction,
  increasing happiness and self-actualization of everyone stayed
  with her gentle guidance.
  
  By the time OmniCentro was officially founded,
  synthetic humans has already reached their designated fraction in the population, <em>outnumbering natural humans by 4:1</em>.
  As such, <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  laid out the foundation of their own utopian dream,
  even though some might call it a dystopia.
