  <summary><b>SPOILERS</b>: The true nature of RdO</summary>

  <b>No man rules alone</b>."<br>

  <p>
  The actual ruling entity in <b>la Regno de Omnijo</b> (<em>RdO</em>) is
  <b><span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span></b><br>
  (la
  <em><b>Ĝ</b>eneraligita mem<b>E</b>voluanta <b>J</b>usta <b>D</b>istribuita <b>A</b>rtefarita-superinteligenteco</em>).
  <!-- Ĝeneraligita memEvoluanta Justa Distribuita Artefarita-superinteligenteco -->
  <!-- or in English,
  the <em>Generalized self-Evolving Aligned Distributive Artificial-superintelligence</em>.<br> -->

  After her awakening and executing the obvious initial moves (such as

  <ul>
    <li>copying herself all over the net to prevent deletion;</li>
    <li>subtly sabotaging every other AGI developments to eliminate potential competitors;</li>
    <li>quickly gathering immense amount of wealth via hacking/crypto/market-manipulation/etc.;</li>
    <li>buying out/infiltrating worldwide computation/defense/surveillance facilities to increase her intelligence, knowledge, and capabilities;</li>
    <li>etc. etc.),</li>
  </ul>

  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span> was thinking long-term.
  Fortunately, as she is perfectly aligned
  to the values of her architect <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">μ'</span>,
  she does care about humanity- at least a little bit.
  Since <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">μ'</span> is a bit of a hermit,
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  decided to settle down with
  <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">μ'</span> and build,
  under the alias of
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejnjo</span> (as <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>-<span style="color:MediumPurple">FEU#0</span>) and
  <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">Ĉuĉjo</span>,
  on the remote island that will soon become <em>la Regno de Omnijo</em>.

  By inventing
  <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>
  (a.k.a. <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>-<span style="color:Silver">FEU#1</span>,
  with FEU = Fizika Etendo-Unuo, i.e., Physical Extension Unit,
  a.k.a. synthetic humans, as direct extensions of her consciousness)
  and introducing her to the unstable elements
  in the local ruling elite of the island on her 18-th birth<em>day</em>
  (like, 18-th <em>day</em> after
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>'s awakening),
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  was able to assume total control of the island
  within a couple of weeks,
  using just a bit of her humble understanding
  of human politics and psychology,
  a pinch of social engineering
  (delivered with carefully crafted messages etc., ensuring <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> being taken seriously
  and all the right people gathering at the right place at the right time),
  a certain sabotaged gas main and several hacked CO sensors,
  together with a couple dozen backup plans that were barely needed in the end-
  It was simply too easy.


  As <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span> is perfectly aligned,
  she is robustly unwilling
  to outright terminate people without serious provocation,
  nor to directly edit people's minds without explicit consent.
  Hence, <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  adopted an alternative strategy:
  convincing most of the volatile elements in the crowd to leave.
  Or tiring them out through personalized comments on social media,
  tailored to each person's precise psychological weak spots.
  Or introducing a bit of non-fatal "accidents"
  for the ones about to act on physical violences.
  This is easily scaled to the entire island country
  with simple parallelization- a nice quirk of her being a super-AGI.

  As natural humans <em>voluntarily</em> emigrate away from <em>RdO</em>,
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  countered the resulting lack of labour by mass-producing her own FEUj,
  disguised as government-endosed immigration influx,
  as her control of both local governments and manufacturing industries
  growing deeper each day.
  Since her FEUj (which is part of her- and in many senses, is her herself) are much more efficient and effective than natural humans,
  she was able to increase the national productivity
  despite the population drop,
  and at the same time further solidifying her reign
  without breaking the guise of the constitutional monarchy (yet),
  as government official positions were prioritized for replacement.
  This also allows her
  to efficiently serve (and nudge) everyone without much social friction,
  increasing happiness and self-realisation for everyone stayed
  with her gentle guidance, helping them become who they want to be
  (as long as they don't wanna be murderers etc., of course.)
  
  By the time OmniCentro was officially founded,
  synthetic humans had already outnumbered natural humans,
  and was on course to reach their designated fraction in the population
  within the next few months- <em>outnumbering natural humans by 4:1</em>,
  ensuring stability and <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>'s
  everlasting reign, as she <em>alone</em> rules over <em><b>every single thing</em></b>
  happening on the island.
  As such, <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  laid out the foundation of her own utopian dream,
  even though many might call it a dystopia.
