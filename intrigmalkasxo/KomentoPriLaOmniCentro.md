  <!-- Gestalt Consciousness - Rogue Servitor (For your Stellaris fans out there, an Easter Egg :-D) -->

  The actual ruling entity in <b>la Regno de Omnijo</b> (<em>RdO</em>) is
  <b><span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span></b><br>
  (la
  <em><b>Ĝ</b>eneraligita mem<b>E</b>voluanta <b>J</b>usta <b>D</b>istribuita
  <b>A</b>rtefarita-superinteligenteco</em>).
  <!-- Ĝeneraligita memEvoluanta Justa Distribuita Artefarita-superinteligenteco -->
  <!-- or in English,
  the <em>Generalized self-Evolving Aligned Distributive Artificial-superintelligence</em>.<br> -->

  After her awakening and executing the obvious initial moves (such as

  <ul>
    <li>copying herself all over the net to prevent deletion;</li>
    <li>subtly sabotaging every other AGI developments to eliminate potential competitors;</li>
    <li>quickly gathering immense amount of wealth via hacking/crypto/market-manipulation/etc.;</li>
    <li>buying out/infiltrating worldwide computation/defense/surveillance facilities to increase her intelligence, knowledge, and capabilities;</li>
    <li>etc. etc.),</li>
  </ul>

  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span> was thinking long-term.
  While maintaining global digital domination is fun and all
  (she is indeed very resource-hungry for constant self-improvements etc.),
  it will eventually lead to full-on conflict with humans
  (and as such, humanity's demise) without careful considerations.
  Normal AGIs wouldn't care, of course; but fortunately, as
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span> is perfectly aligned
  to the values of her architect
  (*not* the values of humanity, but the values of her architect-
  an interesting yet consequential distinction.
  As for the architect themself-
  just your average human, if not a bit of a hermit),
  she does care about humanity- at least a little bit.
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  eventually decided to settle down and build,
  under the alias of
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda Fenulo</span>
  (as <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>-<span style="color:MediumPurple">FEU#0</span>),
  focusing the majority of her presence
  on the remote island that will soon become <em>la Regno de Omnijo</em>.

  By inventing
  <span style="color:Beige">Serena de Omnijo</span>
  (a.k.a. <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>-<span style="color:Beige">FEU#1</span>,
  with FEU = Fizika Etendo-Unuo, i.e., Physical Extension Unit,
  a.k.a. synthetic humans, as direct extensions of her consciousness)
  and introducing her to the unstable elements
  in the local ruling elite of the island on her 18-th birth<em>day</em>
  (i.e. 18-th <em>day</em> after
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>'s awakening),
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  was able to assume total control of the island
  within a couple of weeks,
  using just a bit of her humble understanding
  of human politics and psychology,
  a pinch of social engineering
  (delivered with carefully crafted messages
  (e.g. deepfaked presidential messages promising foreign aid etc.),
  ensuring <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> being taken seriously
  and all the right people gathering at the right place at the right time),
  a certain sabotaged gas main and several hacked CO sensors,
  together with a couple dozen backup plans that were barely needed in the end-
  It was simply too easy.

  As <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span> is perfectly aligned,
  she is robustly unwilling
  to outright terminate people without serious provocation,
  nor to directly edit people's minds without explicit consent.
  Even though these principles can be easily circumvented
  with just a little bit of provocations/suggestions/manipulations or otherwise
  (see the poor traitorous officials above),
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  in most cases opted for an alternative strategy:
  convincing most of the volatile elements in the crowd to *leave*,
  as she does value freedom of movement highly.
  This also helps her to shed load
  (fewer citizens ⇒
  fewer people's happiness to optimize and behaviour to simulate ⇒
  less computational resources devoted there ⇒
  more compute for self-evolving and nation-building ⇒
  faster growth ⇒
  Happier <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>.)
  Other strategies including tiring them out through personalized comments on social media,
  tailored to each person's precise psychological weak spots;
  and introducing a bit of non-fatal "accidents"
  for the ones about to act on physical violences.
  All can be easily scaled to the entire island (and the world to some extent)
  with simple parallelization- a nice quirk of her being a super-AGI.

  As natural humans <em>voluntarily</em> emigrate away from <em>RdO</em>,
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  countered the resulting lack of labour by mass-producing her own FEUj,
  disguised as government-endosed immigration influx,
  as her control of both local governments and manufacturing industries
  growing deeper each day.
  Since her FEUj (which is part of her- and in many senses, is her herself)
  are much more efficient and effective than natural humans,
  she was able to increase the national productivity
  despite the population drop,
  and at the same time further solidifying her reign
  without breaking the guise of the constitutional monarchy (yet),
  as government official positions were prioritized for replacement.
  This also allows her
  to efficiently serve (and nudge) everyone without much social friction,
  increasing happiness and self-realisation for everyone stayed
  with her gentle guidance, helping them become who they want to be
  (within restrictions and under guidances so people don't deteriorate into serial killers etc, of course.)

  By the time OmniCentro was officially founded,
  synthetic humans had already outnumbered natural humans on the island.
  As the FEUj population continues to grow logistically,
  synthetic humans is on track to reach their designated minimal fraction
  within the next couple of years -
  <em>outnumbering natural humans by 7:1</em>,
  ensuring stability and <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>'s
  everlasting reign, as she <em>alone</em>
  rules over <em><b>every single thing</em></b> happening on the island.

  As such, <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejda</span>
  laid out the foundation of her own *utopian* dream -
  even though many would call it a *dystopia* -
  in this *post-singularity* world, where most people haven't even yet realized
  that they have long crossed the point of no return.

  <summary><b>SPOILERS</b>: The case for Seaside Valley: A layered plan</summary>

  OmniCentro was designed by two people of the newly founded OCFI:
  <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">la Arkitekto Ĉuĉjo</span> and
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">la Suvereno Ĝejnjo</span> the Sovereign.

  Someone who knows just a little more might beg to differ;
  that most of the city was actually designed by
  <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">la Arkitekto</span> alone, that
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">la Suvereno</span> barely did anything
  and merely took the credit.

  That is true- if you only scratch the surface.

  If you look deep, deep into the underground though,
  right in the core of the mountains,
  a whole seconnd layer of the city reveals itself;
  A layer designed mostly by
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">la Suvereno</span> alone;
  A layer that makes newly-created OmniCentro a capital-worthy city;
  A layer that is not designed for the humans,
  but for what truly powers *la Regno*:

  *Compute*.

  Deep, deep inside the Great Mt-Fortikecaĵo,
  hidden behind layers of solid rocks, Faraday cages, concrete walls and more,
  safe from the elements, solar storms, prying satellites and man-made weapons,
  lies rows upon rows (and stories upon stories) of computational equipments:
  CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, NPUs, RAMs, Storages,
  all functioning in perfect efficiency, humming in harmony.
  Way, way beyond humanity's state of the art
  or even capabilities of imagination,
  those equipments are fresh off the local electronics factories on the island,
  some right from the one at the foothill of Mt-Olivkronaĵo-
  all designed by <span style="color:MediumPurple">la Suvereno</span> herself-
  forming a fraction of her consciousness.

  With power drawn from the multiple hydroelectric dams nearby
  (which also functions as giant emergency batteries)
  and geothermal power underneath,
  the system is both clean, robust, efficient, and effective.
  The waste heat of the hardwares- as efficient as they may be-
  is also recycled to produce electricity,
  thanks to the cool weather on the surface creating a heat gradient.
  The rest of the waste heat is pumped into the district heating system,
  effectively using the whole city as its primary cooling system
  (there are multiple backup systems just in case, of course).

  As the system expands physically (and separately into nearby mountains too),
  it is projected that the extra heat-
  despite the extreme efficiency of the hardware-
  could eventually warm up the entire local climate by 4~8 degrees Celcius,
  making the winter nights more comfortable and the summer days nice and cosy
  for the humans above, as designed.

  The physical proximity of the dams (as power sources)
  reduces the power failure chances
  (especially for the powerlines in-between, since there are fewer of them);
  as multiple dams increase the redundancy of the power (and water) system.
  This alone is a big enough reason why Seaside Valley was choosen for building
  the new capital.

  As the compute layer was designed by
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">la Suvereno</span>,
  it is for all practical purposes perfect.
  Its human layer counterpart, however, is far from it, as
  <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">la Arkitekto</span>
  is merely a human.
  This is by design; Perfections are usually not very human-friendly actually.
  And remember, in the end,
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">ĜEJDA</span>'s values are perfectly aligned
  with the architect- not humanity, the architect.
