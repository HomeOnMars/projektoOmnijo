#### Background Summary

**OmniCentro** is the new planned capital of the fictional island country **la Regno de Omnijo**,
as commissioned by Omnijo's new young queen
<span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>,
who has already earned herself a reputation of arrogance and recklessness since her coronation just about half a year ago.

(*La Regno de Omnijo* (English: Kingdom of Omnijo) is a fictional monarchy
located on an fictional island
(with the size of approximately iceland,
i.e. $\, \sim 100\, 000\, \mathrm{km}^2$)
in the Southern Hemisphere,
somewhere in between Chile and New Zealand.

For more details, see the history of Omnijo [here](#the-history).)

#### Networks specification details and verification

- Angle $\theta_{d}$ equation:
  $\theta_{d} = 2 \tan^{-1}{\frac{R}{d}}$

  ```python
      # python code
      import numpy as np
      # Remember to translate radian into degree
      theta_deg = lambda R, d: np.ceil(2*np.atan(R/d)/np.pi*180)
      get_R = lambda theta_deg, d: np.tan(theta_deg/2/180*np.pi)*d
      # Example
      print([(d, theta_deg(R=720, d=d)) for d in (512, 256, 128, 64)])
      print(theta_deg(R=4000, d=512), get_R(theta_deg=166, d=512))
  ```

- Analysis of train/truck engine's ability to haul cars:

  ```python
  # getting how many containers/trailers can a train engine haul
  from numpy import sqrt, sin, cos, pi
  from astropy import units as u
  g = 9.8 * u.m / u.s**2
  hp = 746 * u.W
  # load_per_FEU = 24 * u.t    # 24t per trailer / FEU / 2TEU; note default CSL2 is 25t per FEU
  # note: in CSL2, by default,
  #    truck can carry 1 FEU;
  #    freight train can carry 12 FEUs;
  #    container ships can carry 7(height)*6(width)*5(length)+6*5*0.5=225 FEUs;
  #    assuming 24t per FEU, this means truck / train / ships should carry 24t / 288t / 5400t goods.
  # Planned adjustments:
  #    adjust trains to carry 24 FEUs (with 24 trailers and 1 engine;
  #        as 2u/16m per trailer, this means a 400m long train; reserve 28u/448m for rail junctions)

### The History

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(Shorter summary [here](#background-summary).)

**La Regno de Omnijo** (English: Kingdom of Omnijo) is a fictional monarchy
located on an fictional island
(with the size of approximately iceland,
i.e. $\, \sim 100\, 000\, \mathrm{km}^2$)
in the Southern Hemisphere,
somewhere in between Chile and New Zealand.


#### Foundation of *la Regno de Omnijo*

Although it has always been a monarchy since time immemorial
even before the Colonial era,
it used to have a different name **just half a year ago**.
In (fictional) fact, it used to have
a different flag,
a different national color,
a dfferent anthem,
a different official religion, and even
a different official language.
Despite the widespread corruption in the government,
life there was mostly just fine.
However, so much has changed since that faithful day.

<span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> was only **18** when it all happened.
Being your typical long-forgotten heir to the royal throne,
<span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> was pushed to coronate
only days after the (public) re-discovery of her royal blood
after the sudden tragic accidental death of the old king,
by the corrupted ministers and councilors
who saw her as young and easy-to-manipulate for their own personal gain.
But <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> has proven to be
much more impulsive, arrogant, and harder-to-control than they expected.
The corrupted ministers and councilors then plotted
to forcefully retire her with a regime change.
Which they would have succeeded
(they are not stupid, you see, after all they control the military),
if were not for a tragic accident where the building
(next to the one where they were plotting in)
blew up due to a randomly gas leak and CO sensor malfunctions,
killing every single one of them.
How very unfortunate.

After this, <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>
replaced most of the governmental head with her friends
(whom no one has ever heard of),
then re-structured the whole thing,
and then decided to tweak every aspect of country to her own liking.
One would certainly say that
letting someone this young to rule over a country
is starting to have its toll ("Yeah, who would have thought??"), and
such naivety and blatant offence on the ideal of democracy and
even the core identity of the country
is surely going to result in total chaos and disarray.

Yet, not much has happened.

Granted,
the corruption was essentially gone with the reshuffling of the power,
and the friends she put onto the positions
are surprisingly upright and capable,
and within weeks the public goods increased significantly
as <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> disbanded the armies
and re-directed the military fundings there
(for example,

- More telecom towers were built and maintained,
  ensuring good coverage in even the most remote area in the island;
- Transportation were also improved and subsidized,
  with free public transit trial started in several major cities;
- Hospitals received more funding
  to keep them well staffed and maintained,
  allowing them to handle the surge of patients
  from the recent increases in accident rates;
- Even mental healthcare was given the attention it deserves,
  combating the worrying trend of internet burnout epidemic.),

but surely people, being people, would anger and rebel
on the change of everything they know about their own country?

... Or they could leave.
Which is now easier-than-ever, by the way,
as <span style="color:Silver">Reĝino Serena</span>
passed several laws
allowing the renunciation of citizenship,
recognizing dual citizenship, and
providing heavy subsidies for transportations
both coming to and leaving from the country,
as well as a farewell gift package
for those who are leaving but either poor or veteran,
allowing them to easily establish a new life elsewhere.
(It almost felt like she wanted people to leave, or are testing them somehow.)
Regardless, many people did take advantage of this,
and emigration rate skyrocketed for weeks,
as the population quickly dropped.
As a counter measure, <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>
also passed laws to streamline immigration process
as well as to encourage immigrants to move in,
and the immigration influx did increase.
However, it wasn't nearly enough to stop the population drop-
in the beginning.

Then this trend slowed down.

As the next great global economic recession unfolds
(triggered by the bursting of the AI bubble weeks after the coronation day),
many countries are struggling and tighting their immigration rules.
La Regno de Omnijo, however, did surprisingly (again) well,
attracting people to stay.
Actually, from an outsider perspective, Omnijo's response was almost perfect.
<span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> was even able to take the chance
to re-nationalize many of the private companies in her country,
from public transportation to infrastructures and manufacturing industries-
effectively buying out her own country.


#### Foundation of *OmniCentro*

Soon after, the <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span>
announced her new pet project of building a brand new capital,
free from the burden of the history.
She decided to call it **OmniCentro**.
(The level of arrogance...
just sound like <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>'s handiwork.)
The official reason for building a new capital is that
the <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span> think it "would be FUN and COOL."
On the other hand,
the project also creates many new jobs to keep people employed and motivated.
After all, someone has to build the things! and manufracture the materials!
And double-check everything. And triple-check. And quadruple-check.
Yeah, the <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span> is kinda perfectionist,
and she now has the money and the power to live out her own fantasy.

The actual design of the city, though not many care,
falls on <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>'s two friends-
<span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">Ĉuĉjo</span> the Architect and
<span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejnjo</span> the Sovereign
of the newly founded *Omnija Department of Infrastructure* (OCFI).
(These are not their full name, by the way;
it's <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>'s nicknames for the couple.)

It's decided that the new capital will be built
in a valley where mountains meets the sea- a place called the
[Seaside Valley](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/82544/Any),
Or "Ĉemarvalo",
about 300km away from the current capital.
A totally ridiculous place
to build a capital city, of course,
with its lack of flat areas for easy expansion,
its steep altitude changes posing significant problems
for building both buildings and transportation,
and the temperature and wind speed changes at different altitude
are just brutal.
Not to mention that
the local farmers there are famous for not willing to give up their lands.
The only easily capitalizable thing there
is the several good spots for building dams-
but hey, who would ever want a dam / dams this close to the city??
What if they break??

... To which the <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span> simply replied:
"All of those factors would make the city look even COOLER in the end!".

And then, it was so.

Our (soon-to-be) legendary duo now begins the journey,
of building the so-called impossible capital city,
in the valley of *Ĉemarvalo*.




(More coming soon.)
