#### Background Summary

**Regno de Omnijo** (English: Kingdom of Omnijo) is a fictional monarchy
located on an fictional island
(with the size of approximately iceland,
i.e. $\, \sim 100\, 000\, \mathrm{km}^2$)
in the Southern Hemisphere,
somewhere in the middle between Chile and New Zealand.  
OmniCentro is its planned new capital,
commissioned by Omnijo's young new queen
<span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>,
who was just coronated about half a year ago.

(For more details, see the history of Omnijo [here](#the-history).)

#### Sistemo de Unuoj  <br>System of Units


(Detailed descriptions coming soon)

Based on [Planck natural units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units#Planck_units).

Track gauge in *RdO* for trains, metros, and trams are the same:
$$d_\mathrm{gauge} \equiv \pi e ~ 2^{113} ~ l_P = 1.4333 \mathrm{m},$$
which is compatible with the standard gauge ($1.4351 \mathrm{m}$)
with a difference of only $2 \mathrm{mm}$.
(Hopefully that's small enough...)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note:
$l_P \equiv \sqrt{\frac{\hbar G}{c^3}}$
is the [Planck length](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length#):
$c$
is the speed of light,
$\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and
$G$
is the gravitational constant.

***Again, everything here is fictional.***




### The History

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(Shorter summary [here](#background-summary).)

**Regno de Omnijo** (English: Kingdom of Omnijo) is a fictional monarchy
located on an fictional island
(with the size of approximately iceland,
i.e. $\, \sim 100\, 000\, \mathrm{km}^2$)
in the Southern Hemisphere,
somewhere in the middle between Chile and New Zealand.

Although it has always been a monarchy since time immemorial
even before the Colonial era,
it used to have a different name **just half a year ago**.
In (fictional) fact, it used to have
a different flag,
a different national color,
a dfferent anthem, and even
a different official language,
despite also being plagued by the corruption in the government.
However, so much has changed since that faithful day.

<span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> was only **18** when it all happened.
Being your typical long-forgotten heir to the royal throne,
<span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> was pushed to coronate
only days after the (public) re-discovery of her royal blood
after the sudden tragic accidental death of the old king,
by the corrupted ministers and councilors
who saw her as young and easy-to-manipulate for their own personal gain.
But <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> has proven to be
much more impulsive, arrogant, and harder-to-control than they expected.
The corrupted ministers and councilors then plotted
to forcefully retire her with a regime change.
Which they would have succeeded
(they are not stupid, you see, after all they control the military),
if were not for a tragic accident where the building
(next to the one where they were plotting in)
randomly blew up due to gas leaks and CO sensor malfunctions,
killing every single one of them.
How very unfortunate.

After this, <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>
replaced most of the governmental head with her friends
(whom no one has ever heard of),
then re-structured the whole thing,
and then decided to tweak every aspect of country to her own liking.
One would certainly say that
letting someone this young to rule over a country
is starting to have its toll ("Yeah, who would have thought??"), and
such naivety and blatant offence on the ideal of democracy and
even the core identity of the country
is surely going to result in total chaos and disarray.

Yet, not much has happened.

Granted,
the corruption was essentially gone with the reshuffling of the power,
and the friends she put onto the positions
are surprisingly upright and capable,
and within weeks the public goods increased significantly
as more fundings were re-directed there
(for example,

- More telecom towers were built and maintained,
  ensuring good coverage in even the most remote area in the island;
- Transportation were also improved and subsidized,
  with free public transit trial started in several major cities;
- Hospitals received more funding
  to keep them well staffed and maintained,
  even allowing them to handle the surge of new patients
  from the recent sudden increases in accident rates;
- Even mental healthcare was given the attention it deserves,
  combating the worrying trend of internet burnout epidemic.

),
but surely people, being people, would anger and rebel
on the change of everything they know about their own country?

... Or they could leave.
Which is now easier-than-ever, by the way,
as <span style="color:Silver">Reĝino Serena</span>
passed several laws
allowing the renunciation of citizenship,
recognizing dual citizenship, and
providing heavy subsidies for transportations
both coming to and leaving from the country.
Which many people did take advantage of,
and emigration rate skyrocketed for weeks.

Then this trend slowed down and stopped.

With the evolution of the great global economic recession
(triggered by the burst of the AI bubble weeks after the coronation day),
many countries are struggling and tighting their immigration rules.
Regno de Omnijo, however, did surprisingly (again) well,
attracting people to stay.
Actually, from an outsider perspective, Omnijo's response was almost perfect.
<span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> was even able to take the chance
to re-nationalize many of the private companies in her country,
from public transportation to infrastructures and manufacturing industries-
effectively buying out her own country.

The <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span>
even announced her new pet project of building a brand new capital,
free from the burden of the history.
She decided to call it **OmniCentro**.
(The level of arrogance...
just sound like <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>'s handiwork.)
The official reason for building a new capital is that
the <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span> think it "would be FUN and COOL."
On the other hand,
the project also creates many new jobs to keep people employed and motivated.
After all, someone has to build the things! and manufracture the materials!
And double-check everything. And triple-check. And quadruple-check.
Yeah, the <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span> is kinda perfectionist,
and she now has the money and the power to live out her own fantasy.

The actual design of the city, though not many care,
falls on <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>'s two friends-
<span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">Ĉuĉjo</span> the Architect and
<span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejnjo</span> the Sovereign
of the newly founded *Omnija Department of Infrastructure* (OCFI).
(These are not their full name, by the way;
it's <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>'s nicknames for the couple.)

It's decided that the new capital will be built
in a valley where mountains meets the sea- a place called the
[Seaside Valley](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/82544/Any),
Or "Ĉemarvalo",
about 300km away from the current capital.
A totally ridiculous place
to build a capital city, of course,
with its lack of flat areas for easy expansion,
its steep altitude changes posing significant problems
for building both buildings and transportation,
and the temperature and wind speed changes at different altitude
are just brutal.
Not to mention that
the local farmers there are famous for not willing to give up their lands.
The only easily capitalizable thing there
is the several good spots for building dams-
but hey, who would ever want a dam / dams this close to the city??
What if they break??

... To which the <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span> simply replied:
"All of those factors would make the city look even COOLER in the end!".

And then, it was so.

Our (soon-to-be) legendary duo now begins the journey,
of building the impossible capital city,
in the valley of *Ĉemarvalo*.









(More coming soon.)
