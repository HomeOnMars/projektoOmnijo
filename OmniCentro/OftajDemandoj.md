### Pri la Regno

> About the kingdom

> [!WARNING]
> ***Again, everything here is fictional.***

#### ƒàu la Reƒùino aprezas homan evoluon kaj liberecon?

> Does the <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span> value human development and liberty?

Human development generally yes;
as for liberty‚Ä¶ depends on your definition of liberty:

- Freedom of movement

  *Yes*, people are free to leave the kingdom whenever they want.
  All public transits on the island are free,
  and the kingdom is commited to build a comprehensive transit network,
  which should help with this somewhat.
  There‚Äôs also a one-time aid package for the poor
  who decides to renounce their citizenship,
  to help they establish life in other countries.

- Freedom of (all) information

  *Yes*,
  people are free to access all kinds of informations
  (not just in the central gov, but ALL information),
  ~~especially after <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s copyright reform~~ (TBD!),
  as long as the information requested is not dangerous or harmful.

- Freedom of expression

  *Generally yes*,
  people can say whatever they want without repercussions.
  Just don‚Äôt expect the system to amplify their voice
  if they say something unfavorable or nazi-like.

- Right to vote

  *Not really.*
  It‚Äôs technically correct to say the island is a constitutional monarchy
  (the best kind of correct üòÇ),
  but really the power is streamlined and centralized.
  You can vote, but it won't really matter.

- Reproductive rights

  *Not really.*
  While it is respected as a fundamental human drive
  and as a part of human nature,
  <span style="color:Beige">Reƒùino Serena</span> acknowledges that
  uncontrolled reproduction could lead to exponential increase in population,
  leading to overpopulation disasters,
  ~~especially since the <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span> is secretly researching immortality treatments in the hope of distributing them to the global public without international backlashes~~ *Nothing to see here!*

- Right to own physical properties

  *Respected but heavily regulated*
  though taxes (for people) and acquisitions (for companies),
  to prevent anyone (other than the central gov) hoarding all the resources,
  and improve equity.

- Right to own intellectual properties

  **No.**
  All public information known to anyone are considered an integral part
  of that person's/entity's consciousness.
  As long as the information is [public](#kio-estas-publikajn-datumojn-en-la-reƒùino-de-omnijo),
  what anyone (including the gov) see or hear or come to know
  are forever a part of them,
  and forcibly or coercively removing those informations from someone
  are considered *an act of violence*,
  reserved typically only for the central government as a last resort.
  As such, the concept of "intellectual properties"
  is no longer a thing in RdO,
  where intellectual works are seen as contributions
  to the human civilisation,
  and eventual open access guaranteed by law after
  <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s
  [copyright reform](#kio-estas-la-plano-de-la-reƒùino-reformi-kopirajton).

- Right to privacy

  *Depends.*
  People are free to withhold information anytime they want
  without repercussions,
  but the central gov *can* and *will* use whatever non-confrontational means
  to gather information about the state of the world,
  which includes everyone.
  Generally speaking, *all citizens should assume that the central gov already knows everything about them*.

#### Kio estas publikajn datumojn en la Reƒùino de Omnijo?

> What is public data in the Kingdom of Omnijo (RdO)?

Data in RdO refers to everything-
such as information, media, webpages, patents, technology documents, and more!

All data which has been shared with Hx100 (Dx256) people or more
with original author's explicit consent
are considered public.
If it were shared with organizations or companies in which less
than Hx100 people have access to the data,
then it depends on companies' [terms and conditions](#kio-estas-regulojn-de-terminoj-kaj-kondiƒâoj-en-la-reƒùino-de-omnijo).

<span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s
[copyright reform](#kio-estas-la-plano-de-la-reƒùino-reformi-kopirajton)
applies only to public data, in order to protect citizens' privacy
while ensuring open access.

As for private data (data that is not public),
RdO respects and protects the control of the author over its spreading.
*Warning: RdO Central Government is entitied to learn all data worldwide (including private ones), and would do so in any non-confrontational ways.*

#### Kio estas la plano de la Reƒùino reformi kopirajton?

> What is the <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span>'s plan to reform copyright?

<span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s goal here
is *to cut down the fragmentation of human knowledge base*
and *to ensure free and open access* of all kinds of information for all.

In its final form, <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s plan will
replace the concept of intellectual properties with **intellectual works**.
For all non-infohazard works
(ranging from books, tv shows, movies, videos, video games,
webpages, patents, designs, and more),
the author(s) will have **1 year** of full access control for their content
after it was published.
After that, there will be a **Dx15-year** period of limited copyright,
when while the author(s) can still profit from their intellecture work,
the materials will be made available from the official government database
to the general public at a government-determined 'market' price there.
*After that* (i.e. a hexcade (Hx10 ƒµaroj) after publication),
the content will enter **public domain**.

A few more clarifications:

1. All citizens are free to download the content, **build upon** them, and
  publish it after the 1-year period, or earilier if the author consents.
  Part of the profits will go back to the original author(s)
  until a full hexcade after the *original author's* publication date,
  with proportions determined by the work added by each author.
2. All downloads must come with **attribution** info, and
  all publications require proper attribution.
  *This cannot be opted out.*
3. The central gov is commited to build and maintain
  a secure and **full catalog of all humaity's work**, accessible to all.
  It will come with an easily-accessible web-interface
  **with no geographic restrictions**.
  Everyone around the globe can easily download from it
  as long as *their* government don't block it.
  (Web service name TBD.)
4. The central gov offeres authors the option
  to let the gov handle publication for them **directly from gov database**-
  if so, everything will be handled automatically
  and all profits will either be added to author's BdO account automatically,
  or retained as credits in the database system with a bonus,
  which can be used to purchase other people's intellecture works.
  The credit system is done to encourage more creative works.
5. What counts as **"infohazard"** will be determined
  at the central gov's discretion.
6. There will be a **transitional period**.
  Everything published before `Y+10J` (Dx16th year (a hexcade) after
  <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s coronation)
  will have it until `Y+11J` (Dx17th year)
  before author's full control exppires.
  The policy will also be announced in stages- see below.
7. In its final form, this policy applies to **ALL** intellectual works,
  past, present or future, **regardless of their origin country**.
  For any works not in the gov database, whoever bring them to the RdO
  can upload them to the gov database and collect 1/Dx16 revenue
  from the official gov platform as the publisher,
  as long as they attributes the original author(s) properly.
  Should any individual or company around the globe
  denounce the system and *explicitly* refuse to play by these rules,
  the central gov will see them as voluntarily giving up their rights
  and *put those works in public domain immediately upon known*.
  *This action cannot be undone.*
8. The gov only protects the right of what has been logged inside the database.
  **No entry, no protection.**
  The extensive data collection practice of RdO basically ensures
  all works are logged immediately after creation.
9. While the gov does NOT share unpublished works with anyone else,
  should any third party spies on it themselves before original author publish,
  in principal the third party could scoop the publication
  and a the publisher's share of 1/Dx16 of its revenue.
  As long as they properly attribute the original author,
  it would be legal in la Regno.
  As **RdO does not recognize trade secrets**,
  the gov sure did this lots of times themselves
  by publishing companies' receipts/procedures/whatnot.

<span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> plans to announce and implement
her *copyright reform* policy in three distinct stages:

1. Stage 1 / `Y+4J` (4 years after her coronation):  
  Announcement of <span style="color:Beige">her</span>
  reformed copyright scheme, framed as an optional license
  only mandatorily applied to the central government documents and
  nationalized industries.
2. Stage 2 / `Y+8J` (8 years after her coronation):  
  <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> announces that
  her new copyright scheme will now apply to everything ever published within
  the border of RdO.
3. Stage 3 / `Y+10J` (Dx16 years after her coronation):  
  Final form released,
  as <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> announces that
  everything ever published worldwide will be treated under
  <span style="color:Beige">her</span> radical idea,
  whether they like it or not.
  While other countries can block Omnijo's websites,
  the information is still there for free
  for any country who isn't blocking.

As <span style="color:Beige">Reƒùino Serena</span> expects
significant international pushback from her radical idea.
Which is why she delayed the announcement to `Y+10J`
when the kingdom is well-established and self-sufficient,
with its technological supremacy firmly established,
ready for major powers' economic sanctions and/or any potential wars.

#### Kio estas regulojn de terminoj kaj kondiƒâoj en la Reƒùino de Omnijo?

> What are the regulations on terms and conditions (T&C) in RdO?

To make everything as transparent as possible,
and to set the right incentives for the companies,
<span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> decided to overhaul her country's
terms and conditions (T&C) systems.
After she is done, there are two types of T&Cs recognized in the RdO:

1. Standard T&Cs:  
  Those are taught in schools and immigration processes.
  Passing the exams on them are required for receiving the Basic Income
  or becoming a citizen.
  They are used by default for all of RdO's government services
  and nationalized industries,
  unless it's really necessary for custom T&Cs.
2. Custom T&Cs:  
  For custom T&Cs (i.e. where companies write their own T&C),
  the central government service OCR will provide tools
  to companies and citizens
  to automatically summarize terms and conditions automatically with AI,
  in a consumer-facing tone with a maximum length limit,
  personalized based on central gov's understandings
  of everyone's existing knowledge.
  **The AI summary is what is legally binding, not the original document.**
  Companies are encouraged to review the summary
  and update their terms and try again if they are not satisfied.
  The users are required to read the summary carefully.  
  Should the companies decide to opt-out gov-AI-summary, they can, but
  when in court, **it is the companies' responsibility to prove that**
  the user has fully read and comprehended the terms and conditions,
  and that the user is capable of consent.
  **otherwise**, the terms are **automatically voided**.
