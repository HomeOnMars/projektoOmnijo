### Pri la Regno

> About the kingdom

> [!WARNING]
> ***Again, everything here is fictional.***

#### Is the Queen in favor of human development and liberty?

Human development generally yes;
as for liberty‚Ä¶ depends on your definition of liberty:

- Freedom of movement

  *Yes*, people are free to leave the kingdom whenever they want.
  All public transits on the island are free,
  and the kingdom is commited to build a comprehensive transit network,
  which should help with this somewhat.
  There‚Äôs also a one-time aid package for the poor
  who decides to renounce their citizenship,
  to help they establish life in other countries.

- Freedom of (all) information

  *Yes*,
  people are free to access all kinds of informations
  (not just in the central gov, but ALL information),
  ~~especially after <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s copyright reform~~ (TBD!),
  as long as the information requested is not dangerous or harmful.

- Freedom of expression

  *Generally yes*,
  people can say whatever they want without repercussions.
  Just don‚Äôt expect the system to amplify their voice
  if they say something unfavorable or nazi-like.

- Right to vote

  *Not really.*
  It‚Äôs technically correct to say the island is a constitutional monarchy
  (the best kind of correct üòÇ),
  but really the power is streamlined and centralized.
  You can vote, but it won't really matter.

- Reproductive rights

  *Not really.*
  While it is respected as a fundamental human drive
  and as a part of human nature,
  <span style="color:Beige">Reƒùino Serena</span> acknowledges that
  uncontrolled reproduction could lead to exponential increase in population,
  leading to overpopulation disasters,
  ~~especially since the <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span> is secretly researching immortality treatments in the hope of distributing them to the global public without international backlashes~~ *Nothing to see here!*

- Right to own physical properties

  *Respected but heavily regulated*
  though taxes (for people) and acquisitions (for companies),
  to prevent anyone (other than the central gov) hoarding all the resources,
  and improve equity.

- Right to own intellectual properties

  **No.**
  All information known to someone/something are considered an integral part
  of that person's/entity's consciousness.
  What anyone (including the gov) see or hear or come to know
  are forever a part of them,
  and forcibly or coercively removing those informations from someone
  are considered *an act of violence*,
  reserved typically only for the central government as a last resort.
  As such, the concept of intellectual properties dissolved naturally.

- Right to privacy

  *Depends.*
  People are free to withhold information anytime they want
  without repercussions,
  but the central gov *can* and *will* use whatever non-confrontational means
  to gather information about the state of the world,
  which includes everyone.
  Generally speaking, *all citizens should assume that the central gov already knows everything about them*.
