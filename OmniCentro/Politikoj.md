### Aĝo

> Age

#### Adulthood

The Minimum age for adulthood in *RdO*
is Hx 1800 [MŜ](../teknikoj/Unuoj.md#tempo)
(6144 days, or ≈16.82 standard years (Ĵ)),
or ≈ Dx 17 J (*Earth years*) for earthlings.
A person is considered an adult in RdO once they

1. Is at least Hx 1800 MŜ (≈ Dx 17 J) old,
2. Has passed either the *Coming-Of-Age ~~Exam~~ Challenge*
(*Cough Cough*)[^Politikoj-Agxo-0],
3. Has attended the subsequent official *Plenaĝiĝa Ceremonio*
held by the state,
(during which the official ID card[^Politikoj-Agxo-1]
will be awarded to / upgraded for the person).

[^Politikoj-Agxo-0]: This is to ensure that
they is physically and mentally mature enough,
actually has the ability to take responsibilities,
and understands what they is getting into.
Passing the "*Challenge*" is part of the immigration process
for older-than-18-year-old immigrants.

[^Politikoj-Agxo-1]: As mentioned
in the [Bulletin](Bulteno.md#strukturo-de-registaro),
official ID card (adult version) also double as BdO debit cards,
to which the UBI will be issued.

Being considered an adult means that they can

1. Receive full UBI issued by RdO gov (TBD: More details coming soon);
2. Work and earn salaries;
3. Be able to consent;
4. Be responsible for their actions;
5. *Vote*[^Politikoj-Agxo-2] (citizens only);
6. etc. etc.

[^Politikoj-Agxo-2]: While voting is often critiqued by the outside world
as ceremonial-only,
it certainly *feels* like the state is taking it very seriously in *RdO*—
though, more emphasis is on the survey questions
that comes right after the candidate-voting page.
In which, citizens are asked about their
lives, annoyances, desires, hopes and dreams, view on the state, etc. etc.;
and citizens are much encouraged to fill these question out carefully.

#### Education System

The education system in RdO has the following structure:

| Age Group | Stage | Type | Begin Age (Hx JMŜ) | End Age (Hx JMŜ) | Begin Age (Dx J) (*Earth-specific*) | End Age (Dx J) (*Earth-specific*) |
| ------------ | --------------- | ---------- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |

|    Teenagers |     High School | Compulsory |   Ψ |  18 |  11 |  17 |
| Young Adults |         College |   Optional |  18 |  1Ψ |  17 |  22 |
| Young Adults |      University |   Optional |  1Ψ |  28 |  22 |  28 |

|      Elderly  <br>(Non-immortal pop only) |||  68 | ≈80 |  73 | ≈90 |
