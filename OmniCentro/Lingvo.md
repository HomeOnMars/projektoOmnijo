The official language in [RdO](Bulteno.md#fonrakonta-bulteno) is
***Esperanto++*** (often written as `E++`, pronounced as `Eppo`),
a fictional artificial variant of Esperanto
as specified by <span style="color:Silver">Reĝino Serena</span> herself,
aiming to offer maximum regularity for easy learning,
while conforming to the existing world as much as possible.

### Specifoj

> Specifications

Changes of Esperanto++ from Esperanto include:

- Officially eliminated `ĥ` from the *E++* alphabet
  (mostly replaced with `k`);
- Decimal separator in *E++* is `.` instead of `,`;<br>
  Thousands separator (decimal) / ten-thousands separator (hexadecimal) is
  space(` `) instead of `.`;<!-- markdownlint-disable-line no-space-in-code -->
- Built-in support for *hexadecimal* algebra:
  - `Δ λ Π Ψ Υ Σ` written/pronounced as `del lom nak fup gan sig`;
  - `hek`   for            16 (base-10),
  - `jent`  for           256 (base10, = 2^8  or        ΣΣ+1),
  - `gil`   for         4 096 (base10, = 2^12 or       ΣΣΣ+1),
  - `onio`  for        65 536 (base10, = 2^16 or      ΣΣΣΣ+1), and
  - `dunio` for 4 294 967 296 (base10, = 2^32 or ΣΣΣΣ ΣΣΣΣ +1).

  (As a reference, 9 100 000 000 (base10) = 2 1Υ66 Σλ00, pronounced as
  du dunio, gil ganjent seshek ses onio, siggil lomjent.);
- All nouns are now gender-neutral by default,
  unless added surfix `-in-` for female and `-iĉ-` for male.
  - E.g., `viro` is replaced by `viriĉo` for man,
    and `virino` remains to be woman.
  - See also [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_reform_in_Esperanto#Common_elements_to_regularizing_Esperanto_gender).
- etc. etc.
