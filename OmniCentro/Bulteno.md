### Fonrakontaj Resumoj

> Backstories Summaries

**OmniCentro** is the new planned capital
of the fictional island country **la Regno de Omnijo**,
as commissioned by Omnijo's young new queen
<span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>,
who has already earned herself a reputation of arrogance and recklessness
since her coronation just about half a year ago.

*La Regno de Omnijo* is a fictional monarchy
located on the fictional island *la Omnija-Insulo*
in the Southern Hemisphere somewhere in between Chile and New Zealand,
near 56°15'S, 140°15'W (coordinates are fictional- it should be open ocean there in real life).
The island has a size of approximately Iceland,
i.e. $\sim 100 \, 000 \, \mathrm{km}^2$.

For more details, see the history of Omnijo in the [history](#la-historio-the-history) section below.

[^Bulteno-RegistaraTipo]: Interviewer: "So, tell us what do you think
  the kind of government our new *RdO* governemnt *OCR* is?"
  <br>...<br>
  <span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejnjo la Suvereno de OCFI</span>:
  "As stated in the constitution, we are a *Constitutional Monarchy*,
  which has never changed
  since <span style="color:Silver">Reĝino Serena</span>'s coronation.
  As a gentle reminder, next year we are still going to vote
  for the new prime minister."
  <br>...<br>
  <span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">Ĉuĉjo la Arkitekto de OCFI</span>:
  "I understand your concern that the
  <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span>
  has basically replaced the whole cabinet with us
  as acting officials of the government,
  and that the current prime minister functions more like a figure head.
  But I am fairly confident that
  <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>'s heart is in the good place.
  Just look at how much improvements have been achieved in the past 6 months
  to the lives of everyone who chose to stay!
  I would say we are a *Benevolent Dictatorship*."
  <br>...<br>
  <span style="color:Silver">Reĝino Serena de Omnijo</span>:
  "I know many people outside our beloved island considered us
  fallen into a *Totalitarian Regime*... and I agree!
  Like, just yesterday I was starting to implement this new
  universal basic income thing for everyone on the island-
  Sorry for drop the news here, but now ya know,
  it's gonna happen starting next week-
  And did I need to do any research on this policy's effect on the economy?
  Did I need to justify my reasons or answer to anyone or anything?
  Nope! I just go and do that, and no one is there to stop me,
  because everyone in the cabinet is my friend.
  And this absolute power feels SOOOOO GOOD! Muahaha!"
  <br>...<br>
  The public's reactions to the interview are mixed.
  <!-- It certainly didn't help the emigration rate,
  which experienced a small increase after the interview was aired.
  But at this point we doubt if
  <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> even cares about that anymore. -->

[^Bulteno-Religio]: What can I say-
  the <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span> has an taste for
  idealistic causes (though some call them hopeless).
  Regardless, Pastafarianism is more of a
  "believe/leave whenever you want" kind of religion,
  So conversion is optional.
  <span style="color:Silver">Queen Serena</span> herself
  idenfies as only a "part-time" Pastafarian, whatever that means.

[^Bulteno-Koloroj-Argxento]: Silver, symbolizing
  the harsh unbending reality,
  where beauty and complexities hidden deep underneath.

[^Bulteno-Koloroj-Bluo]: Blue, symbolizing
  insights, understanding, and rationality; to see the world as it is.

[^Bulteno-Koloroj-Purpuro]: Purple, as a mixture of pink and blue, symbolizing
  empathies combined with resolutions; to mould the world into what we desire.

[^Bulteno-Himno]: The new anthem is hand picked by -
  you guessed it -
  <span style="color:Silver">Reĝino Serena</span> herself (Surprise, surprise),
  even though she claims to be "not a religious person".<br>
  The official reason is that she "likes the sound of it";<br>
  The unofficial reason may be that it serves as
  a reminder of the state's self-imposed role as the Saviour to its people,
  its promises and duty for their protection and guidance,
  and its call on the people's trust and faith for the state.
