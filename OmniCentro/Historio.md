**La Regno de Omnijo**[^Historio-RdO-Nomo] is a fictional monarchy
located on an fictional island *la Insulo-Omnijo*
in the Southern Hemisphere somewhere in between Chile and New Zealand,
near 56°15'S, 140°15'W (coordinates are fictional).
The island has a size of approximately Iceland or Java island,
i.e. $\sim \frac{1}{2} \mathrm{MU}^2 \approx 130 000_D \mathrm{km}^2$ (TBD).

[^Historio-RdO-Nomo]: English translation: The Kingdom of Omnijo.

Although it has always been a monarchy since time immemorial
even before the Colonial era,
it used to have a different name **just about half a year ago**.
In (fictional) fact, it used to have
a different flag,
a different national color,
a different name for the island,
a different anthem,
a different official religion, and even
a different official language.
Despite the widespread corruption in the government,
life there was mostly just fine.
However, so much has changed since that faithful day.

<span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> was only **18** when it all happened.
Being your typical long-forgotten heir to the royal throne,
<span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> was pushed to coronate
only days after the (public) re-discovery of her royal blood
and the sudden death of the old king
from a tragic traffic accident[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt3],
by the corrupted ministers and councilors
who saw her as young and easy-to-manipulate for their own personal gain.
Unfortunately for them, <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>
turned out to be nothing but docile,
and her impulsivity and arrogance was somehow spinned as "being real"
and won her a dangerously fast increasing popularity among the islanders.

But these corrupted ministers and councilors soon have bigger problems
on their plate.
More specifically- internal power struggles.
Someone somehow broke the status quo and leaked the evidence of the corruption
of a powerful minister at the most inconvenient time possible,
leading to public outcry, him being sacked,
and his retaliation by leaking other politicians' dirty deeds.
The situation quickly escalated in the most dramatic way possible,
resulting in the resignment and/or fleeing of
most of the high level government officials,
while the rest - the highest ranked and actual power controllers -
died when conspiring in a building,
as the adjacent factory blew up in a pure accident caused by a gas leak
and several bad CO sensors malfunction and short-circuit at the same time.
The incident was so bad that no bodies were able to be identified,
though later DNA tests confirmed their identity.
Later evidences suggested that they were plotting to "retire"
[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt2] <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>
and to take the throne to reform the country into a dictatorship,
which they would have succeeded
(they are not stupid, you see, after all they control the military),
if were not for that tragic accident.
How very unfortunate.

[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt3]: \"Accident\" \(\**cough cough*\*\).
Sarcasm aside, the king's body was never found...

[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt2]: Much like they "retired" the old king before <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>.

After that, as the power vaccum was quickly growing out of hand,
<span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> took initiative and
replaced most of the governmental head with her friends
whom no one has ever heard of.
She then proceeded to re-structured the whole government,
and then began tweaking every aspect of country to her own liking.
One would certainly say that
letting someone this young to rule over a country
is starting to have its toll[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt1], and
such naivety and blatant offence on the ideal of democracy and
even the core identity of the country,
even despite the drama beforehand,
is surely going to result in total chaos and disarray.

[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt1]: "Yeah, who would have thought??"

Yet, not much has happened.

Granted,
the corruption was essentially gone with the reshuffling of the power,
the friends she put onto the positions are surprisingly upright and capable,
and within weeks the public goods increased significantly
as <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> disbanded most of the armies
and re-directed the military fundings and personnel there
(for example,

- More telecom towers were built and maintained,
  ensuring good coverage in even the remotest area in the island;
- Transportation were also improved and subsidized,
  with free public transit trial started on the whole island;
- A new smart government services app (`OCR`), backed by OCMI,
  were developed and launched[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt5];
- Hospitals received more funding
  to keep them well staffed and maintained,
  allowing them to handle the surge of patients
  from the recent increases in accident rates;
- Even mental healthcare was given the attention it deserves,
  combating the worrying trend of internet burnout epidemic.),

[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt5]: The OCR app
  handles all sorts of internal affairs from taxes to pensions.
  It uses a personalized approach
  where most forms were already filled out for the users
  based on what the central gov knows about them.
  (No, this personalization cannot be opted-out.)
  It also offers one-to-one consultations with government officials
  who explains the gov and <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s
  position and motivation to the citizens,
  and listens to and answers their concerns.
  Though the waitlist for the consultations is a bit long in the beginning,
  it quickly improved in the next few months.
  Rumor goes that
  the consultants from the app is AI-generated in real time,
  which is almost certainly nonsense
  given the global stagnation of AI development at the time.
  Probably why those rumors come to be in the first place.

but surely people, being people, would anger and rebel
on the change of everything they know
about their own country?[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt4]

[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt4]: On the other hand, there has been
  a few dozens calls for protests circulating online and offline.<br>
  Most of them failed to materialize,
  either due to internal coordination difficulties
  (such as the never-ending arguments about when and where to gather people;
  and by the time they finally made a decision,
  people have already moved on to other things
  the <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span> just announced/implemented.)
  or because <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> is really good at
  using her innocent and lively image to rally people to her cause.
  Her new OCR app becomes really good at listening to people's concerns,
  explaining governments positions, and offer personalized consultations
  within months after its publication.
  If that's doesn't work, they can always speak to the local government
  officials <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> helpfully set up to
  offer face-to-face conversations.<br>
  One counterexample where the protest did successfully
  reach the organization stage still ends up as cancelled,
  as the protesters failed to reach the protesting site
  due to all major highways suffering several car accidents
  hours before the sceduled protest.
  This happened right before <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>
  declared her Free public transit policies, vowing to "fix the traffic", so
  people can always go wherever they want regardless of their social class.<br>
  Another notable example was the strike from the doctors and nurses
  a few weeks before the foundation of *OmniCentro*,
  demanding more pay despite them having higher salary than ever before;
  This eventually resulted in a local celebrity
  entered a near-permanent coma, as no hospital was available
  when she accidentally hit her head that day.
  Together with a few dozens more similar avoidable tragedies,
  a public outcry happened.<br>
  <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> vowed to "fix the healthcare",
  fired ALL of those doctors and nurses- at least the ones working in
  public hospitals (with generous compensations for everyone, of course),
  and re-hired all of the new staff OVERNIGHT.
  One would be crazy to think <span style="color:Beige">she</span>
  can pull this off this time, even though she has obviously been planning
  this mass replacement move since a long time ago...
  But she did.<br>
  The (somehow) much more competent replacement doctors and nurses
  (who are almost entirely made out of the immigrants from
  <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s immigration program)
  successfully made the death rate in hosptial drop to near zero,
  curing became faster, doctors are more empathetic,
  and the overall health level in the entire island began to increase.
  Even that local celebrity was miraculously
  re-awaken from her coma and recovered in record speed.<br>
  Not everyone bought that story though;
  and the emmigration rate reached another high point after this shenanigan.

...
Or they could leave.
Which is now easier-than-ever, by the way,
as <span style="color:Beige">Reĝino Serena</span>
passed several laws
allowing the renunciation of citizenship,
recognizing dual citizenship, and
providing heavy subsidies for transportations
both coming to and leaving from the country,
as well as a hefty farewell gift package
for those who are leaving but either poor or veteran,
allowing them to easily establish a new life elsewhere[^Historio-RdO-Elmigrado-kmt1].
As such, many people took advantage of this,
and emigration rate skyrocketed for weeks,
while the population started to drop quickly.
As a counter measure, <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>
also passed laws to streamline immigration process
as well as to encourage immigrants to move in,
and the immigration influx did increase.
However, it wasn't nearly enough to stop the population drop-
in the beginning.

[^Historio-RdO-Elmigrado-kmt1]: It almost felt like
  she wanted people to leave, or are testing them somehow.<br>
  <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s official statement is that
  "People have a fundamental right to leave if they don't like my style.
  Hate me? Fine. Leave. Go away. Out of sight, out of mind, for me and for you.
  Don't say I didn't give you options."

Then this trend slowed down.

As the next great global economic recession unfolds[^Historio-RdO-Recesio],
many countries are struggling and tightening their immigration rules.
La Regno de Omnijo, however, did surprisingly well (again),
attracting people to stay (or rather, emigration becomes a lot harder).
Actually, from an outsider perspective, Omnijo's response was almost perfect[^Historio-RdO-Recesio-bankoj].
<span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> was even able to take the chance
to re-nationalize many of the private companies in her country -
from public transportation, to utilities, banks, manufacturing industries and more -
effectively buying out her own country.

[^Historio-RdO-Recesio]: This time the recession was triggered by
  the bursting of the AI bubble weeks after the coronation day.<br>
  <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>:
  "I guess this is what happens
  when you temper with things you don't understand LOL-
  If you don't know how it works, you don't know why it stops working
  Muahahahahahaha(beep)" before her new PR officer rushed in
  to stop further recordings of her "evil laugh".<br>
  This interview piece was never publicly aired until a hexcade later.

[^Historio-RdO-Recesio-bankoj]: When the local banks
  (and foreign bank branches) failed,
  instead of bailing them out,
  <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span> opted for directly taking them over-
  Consolidated them into her own newly opened bank "Banko de Omnijo" one by one.
  A move that many considered crazy-
  no one even know where she found enough money in the royal coffer
  to start her own bank (though some guessed that it might
  have something to do with the <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span>'s
  recent involvement in the new cyptocurrency)-
  but ended up working better than expected, actually,
  with much more competent new management
  saving the day and integrating everything. <br>
  With this as an example, <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>
  found it much easier for her governmental Office of Finance `OCMF`
  to take over all kinds of businesses whenever they go bankrupt-
  especially when most of them turned out to be easily savable afterall.
  As for the old management-
  many of them are already cashing out and enjoying the holiday elsewhere
  as Serena's new law allows them to do so and leave
  (like all old employees that got fired-
  who each got very, very generous compensation),
  possibly explaining their over-tendency
  to declare bankruptcy so early and eagerly.<br>
  Another reason for the mass bankruptcy declarations
  may be the never-ending lawsuits
  following <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s
  constant changes to her countries' laws.
  An example: she declared the super-long ALL CAPS PARAGRAPHS
  in so many [terms and conditions](../OmniCentro/OftajDemandoj.md#kio-estas-regulojn-de-terminoj-kaj-kondiĉoj-en-la-reĝino-de-omnijo)
  unreadable and should be automatically voided. <!-- Her original words
  were actually "the terms and conditions should be treated as being
  what the average users think they have accepted,
  instead of what all those empty unreadible words say.",
  This was actually not published and pushed into the law...
  until a while later, bundled with her copy-right law reforms,
  triggering another wave of chaos...  -->
  Which became the law within the next day after its boardcasting.
  While rumor has that big international companies were tipped-off
  about <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s announcements weeks before,
  many smaller and local companies barely had any chances
  to finish re-formating their T&C,
  especially if theirs are already (intentionally) convoluted
  to discourage user reading...
  Within days, a local lawsuit quickly catched the eye of the public,
  where a recently-appointed immigrant judge ruled in lightning speed that
  the company was in the fault, as the pages-long NO LIABILITIES cause deemed
  unreadable and voided.
  The subsequent massive increase in lawsuits following that example
  drove many local companies into bankruptcy...
  meaning they eventually got taken over by the `OCMF`
  in relatively good conditions.

### La fondo de *OmniCentro*

> The foundation of *OmniCentro*

Soon after, the <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span>
announced her new pet project of building a brand new capital,
free from the burden of the history.
She decided to call it **OmniCentro**[^Historio-OC-Nomo].
The official reason for building a new capital is that
the <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span> think it "would be FUN and COOL."
On the other hand,
the project also creates many new jobs to keep people employed and motivated.
After all, someone has to build the things! and manufracture the materials!
And double-check everything. And triple-check. And quadruple-check.
Yeah, the <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span> is kinda perfectionist,
and she now has the money and the power to live out her own fantasy.

[^Historio-OC-Nomo]: The level of arrogance...
  just sound like <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s handiwork.

The actual design of the city, though not many care,
falls on <span style="color:Beige">Serena</span>'s two friends-
<span style="color:#D6B4FC">the Chief Engineer</span> and
<span style="color:#95D0FC">the Architect</span>
of the newly founded *Omnija Department of Infrastructure* (OCFI).
It's decided that the new capital will be built
in a valley where mountains meets the sea- a place called the
[Seaside Valley](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/82544/Any),
Or "Ĉemarvalo",
about 300km away from the current capital.
A totally *ridiculous* place to build a capital city, of course.
Reasons? To name a few: a lack of flat areas for easy expansion,
its steep altitude changes posing significant problems
for building both buildings and transportation,
and the temperature and wind speed changes at different altitude
are just brutal.
Not to mention that
the local farmers there are famous for not willing to give up their lands.
The only easily capitalizable thing there
is the several good spots for building dams[^Historio-OC-barajwo]-
but hey, who would ever want a dam / dams this close to the city??
What if they break??

[^Historio-OC-barajwo]: Several proposals for building hydroelectric dams
  there have been drawn up in the past few decades,
  but unfortunately they all got shot down by nearby NIMBY farmers and
  internal corruptions.

... To which the <span style="color:Beige">Queen</span> simply replied:
"All of those factors would make the city look even COOLER in the end!".

And then, it was so.

Our (soon-to-be) legendary duo now begins the journey,
of building the so-called "impossible" capital city,
in the valley of *Ĉemarvalo*.
