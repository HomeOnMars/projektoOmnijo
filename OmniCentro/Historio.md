**La Regno de Omnijo**[^Historio-RdO-Nomo] is a fictional monarchy
located on an fictional island *la Omnija-Insulo*
in the Southern Hemisphere somewhere in between Chile and New Zealand,
near 56°15'S, 140°15'W (coordinates are fictional).
The island has a size of approximately Iceland,
i.e. $\sim 100 \, 000 \, \mathrm{km}^2$.

[^Historio-RdO-Nomo]: English translation: The Kingdom of Omnijo.

### La fondo de *la Regno de Omnijo*

> The foundation of *la Regno de Omnijo*

Although it has always been a monarchy since time immemorial
even before the Colonial era,
it used to have a different name **just about half a year ago**.
In (fictional) fact, it used to have
a different flag,
a different national color,
a different name for the island,
a different anthem,
a different official religion, and even
a different official language.
Despite the widespread corruption in the government,
life there was mostly just fine.
However, so much has changed since that faithful day.

<span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> was only **18** when it all happened.
Being your typical long-forgotten heir to the royal throne,
<span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> was pushed to coronate
only days after the (public) re-discovery of her royal blood
and the sudden death of the old king from a tragic accident,
by the corrupted ministers and councilors
who saw her as young and easy-to-manipulate for their own personal gain.
But <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> has proven to be
much more impulsive, arrogant, and harder-to-control than they expected.
The corrupted ministers and councilors then plotted a regime change
to forcefully "retire"[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt2] her.
Which they would have succeeded
(they are not stupid, you see, after all they control the military),
if were not for another tragic accident where the building
(next to the one where they were plotting in)
blew up due to a random gas leak and CO sensor malfunctions,
killing every single one of them.
How very unfortunate.

[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt2]: Much like they "retired" the old king before <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>.

After this, <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>
replaced most of the governmental head with her friends
(whom no one has ever heard of) before the power vaccum grew out of hand.
She then proceeded to re-structured the whole government,
and then began tweaking every aspect of country to her own liking.
One would certainly say that
letting someone this young to rule over a country
is starting to have its toll[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt1], and
such naivety and blatant offence on the ideal of democracy and
even the core identity of the country
is surely going to result in total chaos and disarray.

[^Historio-RdO-Serena-kmt1]: "Yeah, who would have thought??"

Yet, not much has happened.

Granted,
the corruption was essentially gone with the reshuffling of the power,
the friends she put onto the positions are surprisingly upright and capable,
and within weeks the public goods increased significantly
as <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> disbanded most of the armies
and re-directed the military fundings and personnel there
(for example,

- More telecom towers were built and maintained,
  ensuring good coverage in even the remotest area in the island;
- Transportation were also improved and subsidized,
  with free public transit trial started in several major cities;
- Hospitals received more funding
  to keep them well staffed and maintained,
  allowing them to handle the surge of patients
  from the recent increases in accident rates;
- Even mental healthcare was given the attention it deserves,
  combating the worrying trend of internet burnout epidemic.),

but surely people, being people, would anger and rebel
on the change of everything they know about their own country?

...
Or they could leave.
Which is now easier-than-ever, by the way,
as <span style="color:Silver">Reĝino Serena</span>
passed several laws
allowing the renunciation of citizenship,
recognizing dual citizenship, and
providing heavy subsidies for transportations
both coming to and leaving from the country,
as well as a hefty farewell gift package
for those who are leaving but either poor or veteran,
allowing them to easily establish a new life elsewhere[^Historio-RdO-Elmigrado-kmt1].
As such, many people took advantage of this,
and emigration rate skyrocketed for weeks,
while the population started to drop quickly.
As a counter measure, <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>
also passed laws to streamline immigration process
as well as to encourage immigrants to move in,
and the immigration influx did increase.
However, it wasn't nearly enough to stop the population drop-
in the beginning.

[^Historio-RdO-Elmigrado-kmt1]: It almost felt like
  she wanted people to leave, or are testing them somehow.<br>
  <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>'s official statement is that
  "People have a fundamental right to leave if they don't like my style.
  Hate me? Fine. Leave. Go away. Out of sight, out of mind, for me and for you.
  Don't say I didn't give you options."

Then this trend slowed down.

As the next great global economic recession unfolds[^Historio-RdO-Recesio],
many countries are struggling and tightening their immigration rules.
La Regno de Omnijo, however, did surprisingly well (again),
attracting people to stay (or rather, emigration becomes a lot harder).
Actually, from an outsider perspective, Omnijo's response was almost perfect.
<span style="color:Silver">Serena</span> was even able to take the chance
to re-nationalize many of the private companies in her country -
from public transportation, to utilities, banks, manufacturing industries and more -
effectively buying out her own country.

[^Historio-RdO-Recesio]: This time the recession was triggered by
  the bursting of the AI bubble weeks after the coronation day.<br>
  <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>:
  "I guess this is what happens
  when you temper with things you don't understand LOL-
  If you don't know how it works, you don't know why it stops working
  Muahahahahahaha(beep)" before her new PR officer rushed in
  to stop further recordings of her "evil laugh".<br>
  This interview piece was never publicly aired until a hexcade later.

### La fondo de *OmniCentro*

> The foundation of *OmniCentro*

Soon after, the <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span>
announced her new pet project of building a brand new capital,
free from the burden of the history.
She decided to call it **OmniCentro**[^Historio-OC-Nomo].
The official reason for building a new capital is that
the <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span> think it "would be FUN and COOL."
On the other hand,
the project also creates many new jobs to keep people employed and motivated.
After all, someone has to build the things! and manufracture the materials!
And double-check everything. And triple-check. And quadruple-check.
Yeah, the <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span> is kinda perfectionist,
and she now has the money and the power to live out her own fantasy.

[^Historio-OC-Nomo]: The level of arrogance...
  just sound like <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>'s handiwork.

The actual design of the city, though not many care,
falls on <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>'s two friends-
<span style="color:DeepSkyBlue">Ĉuĉjo</span> the Architect and
<span style="color:MediumPurple">Ĝejnjo</span> the Sovereign[^Historio-OC-Projektistoj]
of the newly founded *Omnija Department of Infrastructure* (OCFI).
It's decided that the new capital will be built
in a valley where mountains meets the sea- a place called the
[Seaside Valley](https://mods.paradoxplaza.com/mods/82544/Any),
Or "Ĉemarvalo",
about 300km away from the current capital.
A totally *ridiculous* place to build a capital city, of course.
Reasons? To name a few: a lack of flat areas for easy expansion,
its steep altitude changes posing significant problems
for building both buildings and transportation,
and the temperature and wind speed changes at different altitude
are just brutal.
Not to mention that
the local farmers there are famous for not willing to give up their lands.
The only easily capitalizable thing there
is the several good spots for building dams[^Historio-OC-barajxo]-
but hey, who would ever want a dam / dams this close to the city??
What if they break??

[^Historio-OC-barajxo]: Several proposals for building hydroelectric dams
  there have been drawn up in the past few decades,
  but unfortunately they all got shot down by nearby NIMBY farmers and
  internal corruptions.

... To which the <span style="color:Silver">Queen</span> simply replied:
"All of those factors would make the city look even COOLER in the end!".

And then, it was so.

Our (soon-to-be) legendary duo now begins the journey,
of building the so-called "impossible" capital city,
in the valley of *Ĉemarvalo*.

[^Historio-OC-Projektistoj]: These are not their full name, by the way;
  it's <span style="color:Silver">Serena</span>'s nicknames for the duo.
